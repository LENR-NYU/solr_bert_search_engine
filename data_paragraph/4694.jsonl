This relationship has been used to infer the loading ratio in the electrolysis experiments.[1\u22128] However, the in-situ resistance measurement (ISRM) has inherent defects, e.g. the non-uniform distribution of H concentration, temperature, electrolyte and applied currents all influence the measured value. In this paper, we will discuss the electrochemical effects on the ISRM in the direct current (dc) situation."}
