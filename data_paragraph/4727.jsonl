Here, b=4.37\u00d710-13 cm is about the radius of the deuteron, x0=r0/b. \u039b1 is the integration inside the nuclear well; both \u039b2 and \u039b3 are the integration outside the nuclear well. \u039b2 is the integration which involver \u03a6; \u039b3 is the integration which involves \u0398. Hence, \u039b3 represents the resonance effect. Based on the Table I in Bethe\u2019s paper[1], we calculated the contribution from \u039b3 which is more than 50% for his sets of parameters.(see Table I below).", "In the selective resonant tunneling model, an imaginary potential for nuclear well was introduced to make the phase shift complex such that[3]  ] 1 4 Im[{Re[ ]} {Im[ ] 1}4 Im[ ]C krC krCot Cot kCotk + \u2212\u2212= + \u2212\u2212 =\u03bb \u03bb\u03c0 \u03bb\u03b4 \u03b4\u03c0 \u03b4\u03c3.

This feature had been ignored in Bethe\u2019s calculation.", "From Bethe\u2019s early work[1] we may conclude that: (1) Resonance effect is necessary to obtain the correct number for the energy density in the sun; (2) Weak interaction gives correct order of magnitude for fusion reaction in the sun, although it is very weak; (3) Resonant tunneling effect in Bethe\u2019s calculation was not complete.", "[1] H.
