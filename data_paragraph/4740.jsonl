The magni~de of the excess enthalpy expected from cold fusion (i.e. the enthalpy change over and above that established for normal electrochemical processes), and previously claimed by Fleischmann and co-workers [1,2] is so large that it should be easily detected, even with very simple calorimetry. Because \u201ccold fusion\u201d, if it occurs at all, is expected only at odd intervals, or after long induction periods, we employed a calorimeter designed to operate unattended over long periods. For that purpose we constructed a simple diathermal calorimeter monitored with a computer controlled data system.", "In long-time electrolysis runs the amount of material in the calorimeter slowly decreased as D, (or H,) and 0, gassed off, and the assumption of constant mass, which is intrinsic to the development above, was not met. The result was a slow drift in (Tcell - Tbath) which continued until make-up water was added. (Typically about 25% of the starting material was electrolyzed; make-up water was added every few days, and the amount of fluid in the cell was never allowed to drop below 95% of the initial value.) In any event the slow drift from this cause can in no sense disturb the detection of periodic or occasional energy bursts of the kind claimed by Fleischmann and Pons. Those bursts should appear as large peaks on time-temperature plots of the calorimeter data. Indeed, Fleischmann et al. [2] showed figures of several time-temperature plots displaying large transient peaks of this nature.", "Power input to the electrochemical cell is divided into. an efectrochemical part (used to generate gaseous oxygen and hydrogen from the electrolyte) and a thermal part. The latter is calculated from P cell,thermal = (dq/dt)ce*l = (U~/~sr)(~ie~~ -EthJ where US, is the voltage drop across the standard resistor, R,, = 4.919 a, Ucel, is the measured voltage difference between the anode and the cathode of the electrolysis cell, and E,, is the thermochemical voltage as calculated from the free energy of formation of D,O (or H,O for control experiments) from the elements, E,, = -AG,/2F. The free energy is not the standard state value but should be corrected for the fact that neither product nor reactants are in their standard states, nor are the experiments at precisely the standard temperature of 298 K. However, the differences are small and may be neglected at the level of precision appropriate to the present experiments.", "A complete report of our calorimetric effort extending over many months is available [4]. These data, which are not presented here in any detail, can be summarized with the statement that we were unable to detect any thermal inconsistencies which can be attributed to untoward effects such as \u201ccold fusion\u201d (i.e. thermal excursions with time constants between 1 min and several hours yielding heat balances deviating by more than a few percent from the electrochemically calculated values).", "The present calorimeter was designed to detect power bursts during electrolysis of LiOD-D,O solutions using a palladium (or titanium) cathode. Our interest was frankly focused on large excursions from those heating rates expected from normal electrochemical processes. The calorimeter is of sufficient sensitivity to detect an excess power pulse of as little as several minutes duration in runs lasting between several days and several weeks. Our experience with this apparatus during a period of development and use in excess of one year reveal no excess heat production.
