Without doubt, the ITER is the technology dinosaur in the world now. The annihilation of dinosaurs on earth was unavoidable. Biological evolution was faster after that. For similar reasons, the dinosaurs of science and technology will encounter economic and political difficulties sooner or later, but human beings will not lose their ways to explore and utilize the nature. The problem with low energy nuclear reactions is whether human beings are willing to suppress their prejudices and learn what has been discovered during the past 20 years."}
