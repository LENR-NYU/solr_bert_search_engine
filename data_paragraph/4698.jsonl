This makes the reliability depend not only on the measurement of the resistance but also on the accuracy of the relationship between xR and x. On the other hand, the accepted resistance data are measured in the equilibrium or quasi-equilibrium state; the practical hydrogen distribution is non-uniform most of time in ISRM in the electrolysis experiments; this non-uniformity makes the measured hydrogen concentration differ from the average value. At the same time, the electrolyte solution surrounding the electrode affects the ISRM in many ways besides the co-conduction of the measuring current through the electrolyte. The most important effects are the additional potential shifts caused by the measuring current and the electrolysis current (ec). In this paper, we will discuss these problems in turn."}

The cathode was made of a palladium wire (f 0.2\u2000/50\u2000/90 mm, 99.9% purity) wound round a PTFE rod; each cathode end was spot-welded to two platinum leads (f 0.2\u2000/50 mm) for measuring H/Pd by ISRM. The anode was made of a platinum wire (f 0.02\u2000/100 mm) wound round another PTFE rod. All platinum wire leads were covered with thin-walled PTFE tubes to minimize their contact with the electrolyte and catalysis of the H2\u2000/O2 combination. A diaphragm was used in the cell to separate the cathode and anode compartments and prevents H2 and O2 combination. LiOH (1 M) aqueous solution was prepared by dissolving LiOH (No. 3 reagent plant of Shanghai, AR) in deionized H2O. The resistance was measured potentiometrically with the standard four-probe technique. The measuring currents used were 1\u2000/100 mA; the potential drops were measured by a Keithley 15OB microvolt ammeter."}

First, the resistivity ratio, the temperature coefficient of resistance and resistivity, and the resistance of palladium subjected to hydriding\u2000/ dehydriding cycles are discussed. It is found that the resistivity ratio is somewhat higher than the resistance ratio for the same x value and its magnitude depends on the self-stress state caused by hydrogen insertion. The temperature coefficient increases with x when x\u2000/0.7 which was omitted in previous work. The Pd resistance decreases with the number of hydriding\u2000/dehydriding cycles. Second, the effect of the inhomogeneous distribution of x in the electrode on determining the hydrogen content is discussed theoretically. It is proved that the errors are particularly significant when the Pd\u2000/ H system is in the mixed a\u2000/b phase or when the resistance is near the maximum value. Finally, we discuss the additional potential shift and hence the apparent resistance of the PdHx electrode caused by the co-conduction of the electrolyte, the concentrationcell effect and collection of the electrolysis current and imperfections of the electrode configuration in the ISRM. The quantitative expression of these effects is given and some of the theoretical predications are consistent with available experimental results. Some advice is given for measuring the resistance in experiments."}
