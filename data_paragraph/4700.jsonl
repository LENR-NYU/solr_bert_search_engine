The reaction energy of hydrogen absorption heats up the metallic tube and causes the tube wall to desorb hydrogen at the downstream side; therefore the pressure inside the tube increases at the beginning of hydrogen charging. A similar process exists during hydrogen discharging."}

These factors interact with each other and exhibit the super fast diffusion and up-hill diffusion before the emergence of Fickian diffusion. Appearances of super fast diffusion or up-hill diffusion depend on some parameters, e.g. the tube wall thickness, the surface activity, diffusion coefficient of hydrogen in metals and heat transport parameters; only appropriate parameter windows can exhibit all of these phenomena simultaneously. Our results also indicate that the isothermal assumption in the transport experiments is not appropriate unconditionally."}
