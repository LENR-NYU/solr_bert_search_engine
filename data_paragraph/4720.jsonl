In particular, if we consider the excess power per unit electrode surface area as a function of the current density, our result is beyond the general behavior pointed out by Storms [2] by considering many calorimetric measurements on the Pd|D2O system in various laboratories. The applied current density for production of the excess heat in Fig. 3, 44\u201353 mA/cm2 , is lower than the \u2018threshold\u2019 value 100\u2013150 mA/cm2 mentioned by Fleischmann, McKubre and other researchers [1,3,7]. However, it is consistent with the result of Bush and Lagowski [4] who found 10\u201330 mA/ cm2  is enough to produce excess heat using the Calvet calorimetry. At the same time, the loading ratios accompanying the excess heat production in Fig. 3 are between 0.51\u20130.68 D/Pd which are lower than the \u2018threshold\u2019 value, 0.83\u20130.92 D/Pd, first mentioned by McKubre et al [3] and Kunimatsu et al [7]. Both results indicate the \u2018threshold\u2019 current density and D/Pd ratio for anomalous heat production may be \u2018cut down\u2019 using a high sensitivity calorimeter. Of course, our experiment was performed at a higher temperature (40 \u00b0C) than before used (20\u201330 \u00b0C), this difference may cause the triggering condition of the excess heat being modified. On the other hand, these results are qualitative and the quantitative relation of excess power vs. current density and loading ratio needs further research in future works."}
