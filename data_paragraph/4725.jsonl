Since tungsten electrode was used also, there should be a de-excitation process: 184W* 9 184W + \u0131 (E\u0131=110 keV). If the low energy spectrum could get rid of the noise, one should have seen the 110 keV gamma-ray as well. Recently an unexpected peak has been seen around 130 keV, which could not be attributed to any Coulomb excitation process. Fortunately, Professor Hagelstein is just looking for a peak around 129.5 keV to explain his neutron transfer reaction."}

It is clear that the reproducibility depends on the loading process. The annealing in the vacuum, and the multiple-step loading have been identified as two important factors which may affect the terminal loading ratio. Table 1 and Table 2 in Ref. 11 summarize the gas-loading experiments with palladium in hydrogen and in deuterium. It is possible to reach the loading ratio of D/Pd >0.84 by annealing in the vacuum, and multiple-step loading under 30 atm."}

The Institute of Chemistry, Academy of Science, keeps a small group using microcalorimetry[12]; and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Science at High Temperature and High Pressure, Chengdu University of Science and Technology keeps doing electrolysis of heavy water with titanium cathode and platinum anode[13]. They measured the temperature inside the Ti-rod, and observed the extraordinary ascent of temperature five times among seven experiments. Although the explanation of extraordinary ascent of temperature is unclear yet, they found that if a mixture of H2O and D2O was used as the electrolyte, then no extraordinary ascent of temperature was observed. The extraordinary ascent of temperature was about 1.5~24(C dependent on the size of the Ti-rod. The SIMS (secondary ion mass spectrum) analysis showed strangely that the Ti-rod sample above the water level absorbed much more hydrogen than deuterium if there was some H2O in the electrolyte. However, the Ti-rod sample beneath the water level absorbed both deuterium and hydrogen. The hardness and the metallurgical structure of the Ti-rod were monitored before and after electrolysis."}

If the electron cloud shrinks to form a strong screening effect, an energy level lower than usual ground level is always assumed. The Mills model[21] or the solutions of the relativistic Schrodinger equation and Dirac equation[22] are invoked to find this energy level, but the uncertainty principle is not compatible with it. A multiple body problem in the crystal lattice should be investigated."}
