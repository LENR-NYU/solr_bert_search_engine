However, because not all of these variables are orthogonal, it is necessary to establish their dependent relation in further research. One of these relations is the loading ratio as a function of temperature [4-8]. Mengoli et al have found that the loading ratio of D in Pd, xD decreases with temperature by a slope of \u00b6xD/\u00b6T ~ - 1.1 \u00b4 10 - 3 K-1 under the potentiostatic charging condition in the temperature range from 25 \u00b0C to 90 \u00b0C [4]. The same group have also found that \u00b6xH/\u00b6T ~ - 1.6 \u00b4 10 - 3 K -1 under the galvanostatic charging condition and \u00b6xH/\u00b6T ~ - 8.7 \u00b4 10-4 K-1 under the potentiostatic charging condition with the H3PO4 electrolyte from 25 \u00b0C to 175 \u00b0C [6].

In this paper, we will deal with this subject in detail.", "Consider hydrogen absorption into a PdHx electrode in the HER (taken to include D, the same below). At the outer surface, there are three steps, i.e. the Volmer, Tafel and penetration reactions taking place at the same time [10,11]. The rate of the Volmer step is the applied current density (CD) and the rate of the Tafel step is: Eq. (1). Because the penetration reaction is very rapidly, it is in pseudo-equilibrium [11] and we have the isotherm: Eq. (2). In Eqs.
