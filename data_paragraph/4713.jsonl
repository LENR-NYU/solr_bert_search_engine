In short time interval (100~ 300sec) only changing the thickness L, the change of energy spectrum and intensity of x-ray was regular (not random) and might be repeated. This meant the counts of x-ray were not affected by electromagnetic disturbance obviously. For check and comparison, we also applied thcrmoluminesccn t dosimeters (TLD) and Nal detector to measurement of x-ray dose, TLD was not affected by electromagnetic noise. Using Pb attenuation foil of 5mm thickness , TLD recorded the intensity of 4 times background; Using Pb attenuation foil of 1,2,6mm thickness simultaneously, the discharge voltage was 14kV, TLD recorded the intensity of 77.6, 35.1, 8.6 mR (milli Rongcn) respectively, the background was about 2.4 mR. So we might obtain the average mass attenuation cross section: (\u00b5Ip)= 0.734(1 ~ 2rnm),0.367(2~ 6mm)cm2 I g, the corresponding x-ray energy was 214 keV and 277 kcV, this strongly supported above measuring results about there were 100~ 300keV high energy x-ray in the low voltage gas (D2,Hi) discharge."}
