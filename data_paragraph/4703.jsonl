The excess heat was qualitatively reproducible for some samples. Ti additions to the electrolyte improved reproducibility of excess heat, possibly by depositing on the cathode and catalyzing reactions which produce excess heat. Localized changes in the surface topography of the Pd cathodes correlate with changes in the characteristic X-ray peaks of Pd. As before, these are interpreted in terms of localized concentrations of Ag, which is thought to be produced during electrolysis."}
