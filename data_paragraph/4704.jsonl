Here we report the results of isoperibolic calorimetry and SEC obtained with the same electrolytic system. As described before [1\uf02d3], we used two cells with the same dimensions, one containing Pd|D2O+H2SO4 and another containing Pt|H2O+H2SO4. The concentration of H2SO4 in each cell is adjusted to ensure that the voltages and hence the input powers of these two cells are close to each other at the same current. These two cells are placed in a cardboard box (14 \uf0b4 17 \uf0b4 17.5 cm3, 4 mm wall thickness) inside the SEC. Temperatures, current, voltages and the SEC signal are recorded with a data acquisition system. The results are shown in Fig. 3. We find that these two methods give the same excess power, within the precision of the measurements. This suggests that excess power results reported before [1\uf02d3] are likely to be accurate."}

Ni was listed as \u201cnot detected\u201d in the chemical analysis provided by the vendor of the Pd foil. It is very unlikely to have resulted from the cold rolling process or from electrodeposition because it is highly localized near one corner of the cathode. If it is the result of either contamination from the rolling mill or from electroplating it should not be highly localized on only one corner of the cathode. It could not have resulted from SEM systems because the stainless steel components of the SEM chamber also contain Fe and Cr. Fe and/or Cr are not present in any of the spectra. The SEM does not have components made of pure Ni. Therefore, the origin of the Ni is not known."}
