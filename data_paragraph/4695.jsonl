The Calvet calorimeter is one of standard equipments in thermokinetic studies; it not only provides a high sensitivity but also depends weakly on the thermal homogeneity (the isoperibolic assumption) in the measuring vessel. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out power measurements in closed Pd|D2O electrolysis systems using the Calvet calorimeter. In this paper, we will report some of these results obtained in our laboratory."}

However, similar results have also been detected in Pd|D2O and Ni|H2O systems [4] and La0.95AlO3 + D2 system [5] before. Therefore, it should be another effects in cold fusion. Nevertheless, this phenomenon needs to be studied more detail since the related evidences and reproducibility are lacking. Currently we are organizing a new series of experiments on this study."}
