The UHD phenomena, the time courses of pressure change in a tube during hydrogen absorption and interruption of steady di'usion [1,2,13\u201324] were demonstrated and interpreted by these theories. Besides these phenomena, it has been found that self-stresses lead to changes of apparent di'usion coe6cient (ADC) if traditional relations are applied in experiments [1,2,13\u201326]. This is one of the reasons that ADCs of H in metal (alloy) hydrides di'er from one work to another. Because self-stresses are produced by the nonhomogeneous concentration distribution of hydrogen in metals and this is a necessary condition for di'usivity measurement, so self-stresses must a'ect di'usion processes, hence the di'usivity measurements. Therefore, it is important to diminish or subtract this e'ect in experiments. On the other hand, effects of self-stress on the transport of hydrogen in metals (alloys) are an important problem in corrosion kinetics, hydrogen storage and other related problems. All these issues form the academic and technological backgrounds of the present subject; we will discuss it using numerical methods based on the model established earlier [9\u201311]."}

It is found that ADCs di'er from the SFDC when either the initial concentration or the chemopotential (or 9ux) step is large. Generally, ADCs are less than the SFDC under the chemopotential-step, i.e. the pressure-step for gas absorption or potentiostatic charging for electrochemical absorption. However, ADCs are greater than the SFDC under the 9ux-step, i.e. the galvanostatic charging. At the same time, we Pnd that the self-stress e'ects are proportional to the partial molar volume of hydrogen in metals but inversely proportional to temperature. Our results indicate that ADCs approach the SFDC only if the initial concentration and concentration-step (or 9ux-step) are small enough or the temperature is high enough. In measurements of di'usion coe6cient with nonzero hydrogen concentration (nH \u2000= 0), the e'ective technique is using the galvanostatic charging with small current. Finally, our theoretical results are consistent with the available experimental data."}
