The cross-sections of nuclear reactions are six orders of magnitude smaller than those of chemical reactions, and nuclear reaction processes are much faster. Consequently, in most cases, the chemical environment has minimal influence on nuclear processes, except for rare occurrences like the M\u00f6ssbauer effect. This demonstrates the chemical independence of nuclear properties. In contrast, condensed matter nuclear science presents a different scenario. Experimental findings have revealed that specific physical and chemical conditions can greatly enhance certain nuclear reactions. This bridging of the gap between traditional nuclear physics, physical chemistry, and condensed matter physics eliminates the need for large accelerators and tokamaks in the study and utilization of nuclear energy. The significance of this development cannot be overstated."}

Therefore, it is now possible to achieve permanent and safe disposal of radioactive nuclear waste from nuclear power plants and nuclear disarmament through this approach. Figuratively speaking, cold fusion can not only replace hot fusion as a driving force but also clean up after nuclear fission. Therefore, the development of condensed matter nuclear science may not only bring about scientific and technological revolutions but also potentially change human lifestyles and geopolitical dynamics. Some of these impacts are foreseeable, while others go beyond current human imagination."}
