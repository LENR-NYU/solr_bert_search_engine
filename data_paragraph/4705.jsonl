Thermal conductive adhesive is used to mount the copper tubing and the aluminum walls. The outlet of the copper tubing is connected with the hose of a refrigerating/heating circulator (PolyScience 9112). The temperature range of this circulator is \uf02d20 to 200\u00b0C; the temperature stability is \u00b1 0.01\u00b0C; and the pump outlet flow rate of the working fluid is 15 to 22 liters per minute. The inlet of the copper tube around the outer box is connected with a small cylindrical heat sink (\uf066in 20 mm \uf0b4 hin 50 mm); a remote, circular temperature probe is placed in it. This arrangement of the temperature probe ensures that the fluctuation of ambient temperature does not affect the calorimeter. The inlet of the small heat sink is connected to the circular probe with another hose. The hoses are wrapped with a polystyrene foam tubing to prevent heat losses. The calorimeter core is placed in a larger box with inner dimension of 70 \u00d7 70 \u00d7 70 cm3. Heat insulation materials fill the gap between these two boxes."}

One example of excess heat is shown in Fig. 3(b). We performed 11 experimental runs. Six of these produced excess heat, ranging from 0.15 to 0.41 W, as shown in Table II. Run #3 had only the E (experimental) cell and not the C (control) cell; it also showed the excess heat. The total excess heat was 54 kJ and average excess power was 0.22 W in these 6 positive runs. Excess power measured by IPC and SEC were qualitatively consistent as shown in Table II."}
