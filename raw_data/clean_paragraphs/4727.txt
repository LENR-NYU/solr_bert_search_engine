1 Introduction 

In 2000, Dr. Roberto Andreani made a speech on closing session of the ICCF-8 (Lerice, Italy) that fusion energy
is not necessary accompanied with the neutron radiation. He said that the solar energy was originated from
proton-proton fusion, but there was no neutron accompanied. R. Andreani was the deputy director of the hot fusion
project in ENEA (Frascati), Italy. He was leaving for Garching, Germany to work as the deputy director of the
European team for ITER project. However, he paid attention to the cold fusion project from the beginning, and he
did not refuse the cold fusion. Radiation-less fusion energy is a strong point of “cold fusion”. There was no reason to
discredit the “cold fusion” just based on lack of neutron radiation. Selective resonant tunneling model was proposed
in 1995 to explain why the fusion reaction should not be accompanied with neutron radiation. It is interesting to
investigate how Bethe obtained his solar energy density in 1938, which was one of his merits to win the Nobel Prize
later in 1967[1] 


2 Bethe’s Calculation of the Solar Energy Density 

2.1 Resonance Effect:
Bethe clearly mentioned resonance twice in his paper [1], and the contribution from the resonance was more
than one half of the total fusion cross section (see Table I in [1]). It is understandable, because Bethe believed that
the temperature of solar plasma was 2 keV only which was much lower than the height of the Coulomb barrier
between two protons. The quantum mechanics tunneling without resonance might not be enough to provide the solar
energy density in order to meet the observation in astrophysics. 

Bethe assumed a square-well for nuclear interaction, and a pure Coulomb potential outside the nuclear
interaction region between two protons. Hence, three parameters would be needed in order to determine the wave
function of the relative motion of two protons in their center of mass system. These parameters were the depth and
the radius of the nuclear potential,( D and r0, respectively), and the kinetic energy of the incident proton (E ). In
Bethe’s terminology, resonance just meant the mixture of the regular Coulomb wave function (F0) with the irregular
Coulomb wave function (G0). The ratio of the mixture was determine by the phase shift of the Coulomb wave
function (δ0 ). Here the subscript 0 just means the s-partial wave of the wave function. This phase shift, δ0 , might be
calculated when the abovementioned three parameters were fixed.

Here, v is the relative speed between two protons. Under the Bethe’s approximation, ζ is independent of the incident
energy, E. Φ and Θ approach 1 when r→0. Tanδ0 depends on energy E through C2
kr0 only, which is quite small due
to the Coulomb barrier and the small value of k. This dependence will have a Gamow peak when the Maxwell
velocity distribution of protons was considered. However, it is interesting to notice that even if the
Tanδ 0 = 0.0017 at this Gamow peak, the contribution of this G0 to the fusion cross section is more than 50% in the
final expression for the total cross section (see Table I later). We may see that resonance is an important factor in the
low energy fusion reaction. Particularly, when the nuclear potential well was assumed such that Tanδ0 >>1; then, the
resonance effect would reach its maximum value, and dominate the fusion cross section. 

2.2 Weak Interaction 
Bethe clearly stated that weak interaction played key role for the fusion reactions in the sun. Four protons would
be eventually combined together to form an alpha-particle and emit two positrons. The energy released is 26.8 MeV.
Although a chain of reactions might be involved in the whole process, the first reaction was the formation of
deuterons by proton combination, i.e.
p + p →d + e+ + νe 
The Fermi constantfor this weak interaction was a very small number g:
g=0.9×10-4 sec-1, hence, the perturbation theory was applied to calculate the transition probability from the 2 protons to the ground
state of deuteron. The cross section for the combination of two protons of relative velocity v was given by
σ = ψ ψ dτ v g f W p d^2
Here, f(W)=0.132(the Coulomb correction factor in weak interaction), and
)( )2(4 )2021 2 32 22 2− + +Λ + Λ + Λ = ∫.
Here, b=4.37×10-13 cm is about the radius of the deuteron, x0=r0/b. Λ1 is the integration inside the nuclear well; both
Λ2 and Λ3 are the integration outside the nuclear well. Λ2 is the integration which involver Φ; Λ3 is the integration
which involves Θ. Hence, Λ3 represents the resonance effect. Based on the Table I in Bethe’s paper[1], we
calculated the contribution from Λ3 which is more than 50% for his sets of parameters.(see Table I below). 


3 Selectivity of the Resonant Tunneling

From the abovementioned discussion, we can see that Bethe’s calculation did not consider the selectivity of the
resonant tunneling, because Bethe did not consider the effect of the absorption on the wave function. The phase shift,
Tanδ0, was a real number in Bethe’s calculation. Indeed the phase shift should be a complex number in case of
fusion reaction. Consequently, the tunneling probability in Bethe’s model did not show any dependence on energy
other than Gamow factor (2πη exp[-2πη]) and geometric factor (1/k
2
); therefore, there was no selectivity in the
resonant tunneling effect in Bethe’s approximation. 

In Bethe’s approximation, the dependence of cross section of fusion reaction on the energy appeared only in
C2
/v. Two dependences on energy are neglected. The first is the k1, which is the wave number inside the nuclear well.
When nuclear well is deep, and the incident energy is low, |E/D| <<1; hence, k1 is almost independent on E. The
second is the dependence of Θ on E. In Landau’s approximation [2,3],
Θ = 1 + y Log y + γ − + h ka 

This weak dependence on ( ) is important for the selectivity of resonant tunneling also.

In the selective resonant tunneling model, an imaginary potential for nuclear well was introduced to make the
phase shift complex such that[3] 
] 1 4 Im[{Re[ ]} {Im[ ] 1}4 Im[ ]C krC krCot Cot kCotk + −−= + −− =λ λπ λδ δπ δσ.
The complex nuclear potential makes λ complex, and those abovementioned two dependences on energy make

This feature had been ignored in Bethe’s calculation.


4 Concluding Remarks

From Bethe’s early work[1] we may conclude that:
(1) Resonance effect is necessary to obtain the correct number for the energy density in the sun;
(2) Weak interaction gives correct order of magnitude for fusion reaction in the sun, although it is very weak;
(3) Resonant tunneling effect in Bethe’s calculation was not complete.
