1. Introduction

Since the discovery of the anomalous excess heat in the Pd|D2O electrolytic system [1],
there have been continuing controversies on this result in the scientific community; one of
the problems is the calorimetric method. As predicted by Storms in an extensive review [2],
the isoperibolic calorimetry used by Fleischmann and other researchers introduces some
uncertainty and complexity, e.g. the problems of inhomogeneous distribution of
temperature in the electrolyte, recombination of D2 and O2 gas in the cell and effect of the
stagnant water layer at the cell wall on the thermal conductivity of the wall etc. Strictly
speaking, the isoperibolic calorimeter usually measures overall heat but not power at any
time in a process. Another widely using method in cold fusion experiments, the mass-flow
calorimetry, is adapted but not preferred means in power measurement at present. On the
other hand, the Calvet calorimetry has been used in thermokinetics for more than a half
century. It not only provides a high sensitivity but also depends weakly on the thermal
homogeneity (the isoperibolic assumption) in the measuring vessel. The great differences
between these three methods can be demonstrated by the magnitudes of the minimum 
value of current density for excess heat production in the Pd|D2O electrolytic system.
Based on the results measured by the isoperibolic and mass-flow calorimetry, Fleischmann
et al [1], McKubre et al [3] and other researchers all mentioned that the minimum current
density (known as the ‘threshold value’) is 100–150 mA/cm2. Nevertheless, Bush and
Lagowski [4], and our results showed that 10–50 mA/cm2 is enough to produce excess heat
using the Calvet calorimetry. This fact indicates that the anomalous excess heat can be
easily detected, in other words the critical requirement for reproducibility of the anomalous
excess heat can be ‘cut down’, by using high sensitivity calorimetry.

Starting in 1989, our group has been continually involved in studying the anomalous
excess heat in the Pd|D2O (H2O) electrolytic system by the Calvet calorimetry [5] as well
as some material and electrochemical characteristics of Pd|D (H) electrode [6]. In the
present paper, we report some of the result obtained in the last experiment.


2. Experimental

The electrolytic cell consisted of a glass vessel (inner f 12 ¥ 40 mm) and electrodes in
the LiNO3 + D2O solution as shown in Fig. 1. The cathode was made of a palladium wire
(f 0.2 ¥ 50–90 mm, 99.9% purity) wound round a PTFE rod, each cathode end was spot
welded to two platinum leads (f 0.2 ¥ 50 mm) for measuring atomic ratio of D/Pd by the
resistance method. The anode was made of a platinum wire (f 0.02 ¥ 100 mm) wound
round another PTFE rod. All platinum wire leads were covered with thin-walled PTFE
tubes to minimize their contact with electrolyte and catalysis of D2 + O2 combination. Both
the cathode and anode were partially inserted in an appropriately machined PTFE piece,
which ensured good permanent positioning of the electrodes and fixed distance (ca. 2 mm)
between them. A diaphragm made of a PTFE plate with thin holes in it was used in the cell
to separate the cathode and anode compartments and to prevent from D2 and O2 gas
bubbles mixing. The 5 M LiNO3 heavy water solution was prepared by dissolving LiNO3
(No. 3 reagent plant of Shanghai, AR) in D2O (Beijing chemical plant, 99.8% isotopic
purity). The cell was filled with about 2 ml of the electrolyte solution.

The electrolytic cell was coiled with an isolated resistance wire as a calibration heater
and placed in a stainless steel container (inner f 16.9 ¥ 60 mm). An appropriate amount of
silicon oil was filled in the space between the glass vessel and stainless steel wall for good
heat conductivity.

Figure 2 shows the experimental apparatus. A microcalorimeter, LKB 2107 made in
Sweden, was employed in our work, it is a kind of instrument used to determine the heat
flow evolved or absorbed in a process undergoing in a system and it is used widely in
thermokinetic studies. The overall thermal flux produced in the system converts to
electromotive force, and has a simple linear relationship to the output signal in voltage.
This sort of calorimetry avoids the problem of inhomogeneous distribution of temperature
in the isoperibolic calorimetry, and has much more sensitivity than the mass-flow
calorimetry. The effect of slight temperature fluctuation around the calorimeter is
eliminated by the twin cell design. The temperature in the air bath in which the calorimeter 
is mounted was maintained at 40.00 ± 0.02 °C.

With multiplexed computer data acquisition, the data associated with the input power,
output power and D/Pd ratio were displayed in real time on the computer monitor and also
stored on disc using a software package.

Finally, all electrolysis was carried out under the galvanostatic condition, the applied
current was typically between 25 and 30 mA, which was measured as a voltage drop across
a standard resistor. The light water solution was used in blank experiments for comparison.


3. Results and discussion

In order to verify the accuracy and reliability of the calorimeter, a number of calibration 
experiments were performed with Joule heating after the temperature in the air bath and
calorimetric experimental zero were stable. It was found that the precision was better than
± 2% with the applied power being just about that of the electrolysis and the device
constant did not change within the error 1% before and after the electrolysis.

A run of calorimetric experiment on the Pd|D2O (H2O) electrolytic system was always
carried out over several days. In general, the calorimetry on the electrolytic system lasted
about 20 hours. Between two calorimetric experiments, the calorimeter was calibrated and
heavy water (light water) was added into the electrolytic cell to compensate the D2O (H2O)
consumption in electrolysis and the evaporation in the gas stream escaping from the cell
although the latter was very small.

The excess power is calculated from the input, output and water electrolysis powers:
 Pex = Pout + IVth - IV
where Pout is the output power measured by the calorimeter; I is the applied current; V is
the measured potential drop across the electrolytic cell; Vth is the thermoneutral potential in
the water electrolysis, Vth = 1.524 and 1.478 V at 40 °C for D2O and H2O, respectively.

There have been seven runs of calorimetric experiment on Pd|D2O (H2O) electrolytic
systems being performed in two months period. Most of Pd|D2O systems exhibited excess
heat in different magnitudes of excess power and sustaining time. Two runs of calorimetric
results throughout the experiments for Pd + D2O and Pd + H2O systems are shown in Figs.
3 and 4, respectively. Each figure shows the output power and excess power calculated
according to Eq. (1) in less than one-day period. The applied current, resistance ratio of
PdHx to Pd (R/R0) and loading ratio of D/Pd are noted in each figure.

By Figs. 3 and 4, we find that both the D2O and H2O systems exhibit excess heat (ca.
500-800 J) at the beginning of electrolysis. Because it is greater than the enthalpy of
palladium deuteride (hydride) formation (£ 5 J) and any chemical process associated with
LiNO3 is endothermic, so we only attribute it to unknown chemical process, which needs
further research in future. Subsequently, both these two systems experience the trivial time
of no excess heat. The distinction between them appears at the latter time, we find the
excess heat is produced in the Pd|D2O system on the third day and it lasts for 4 days;
otherwise, the Pd|H2O system exhibits no any excess heat during the rest time and it also
provides a calibration for the calorimeter in some sense. These results clearly indicate that
the Pd|D2O electrolytic system produces anomalous excess power.

For result in Fig. 3, the average excess power over 79 hours is 0.025 W which
corresponds to a volume excess power of 8.75 W /cm3 Pd or a surface power of 0.044 W/cm2 Pd. The maximum excess power shown in Fig. 3 is 0.035 W, the ratio of excess power
to input power ranged from 48% to 83%. The overall excess heat corresponds to 2.48
MJ/cm3 Pd or 228 eV/atom Pd which appears to be well beyond any chemical process can be expected to release.

Our calorimetric results showed an excess power that was quite in line with other
positive results reported up to now. In particular, if we consider the excess power per unit
electrode surface area as a function of the current density, our result is beyond the general
behavior pointed out by Storms [2] by considering many calorimetric measurements on the
Pd|D2O system in various laboratories. The applied current density for production of the
excess heat in Fig. 3, 44–53 mA/cm2
, is lower than the ‘threshold’ value 100–150 mA/cm2
mentioned by Fleischmann, McKubre and other researchers [1,3,7]. However, it is
consistent with the result of Bush and Lagowski [4] who found 10–30 mA/ cm2
 is enough
to produce excess heat using the Calvet calorimetry. At the same time, the loading ratios
accompanying the excess heat production in Fig. 3 are between 0.51–0.68 D/Pd which are
lower than the ‘threshold’ value, 0.83–0.92 D/Pd, first mentioned by McKubre et al [3] and
Kunimatsu et al [7]. Both results indicate the ‘threshold’ current density and D/Pd ratio for
anomalous heat production may be ‘cut down’ using a high sensitivity calorimeter. Of
course, our experiment was performed at a higher temperature (40 °C) than before used
(20–30 °C), this difference may cause the triggering condition of the excess heat being
modified. On the other hand, these results are qualitative and the quantitative relation of
excess power vs. current density and loading ratio needs further research in future works.
