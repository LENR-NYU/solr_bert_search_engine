1. Introduction

Migration of hydrogen interstitials in metals and alloys
has been studied widely in science and technology
[1–4]. It is well known that a time-lag is necessary for
a diffusion wavefront to be detected at the downstream
side of a foil while the hydrogen is charged at the upstream
side. In 1980s, Lewis et al. found that self-stresses
produced by hydrogen insertion into metals and alloys
induce the up-hill diffusion (UHD) at the downstream
side before the time-lag of the diffusion process [5–17].
Since then, the self-stress effects of hydrogen in metals
and alloys have been studied extensively [5–21]. Recently,
this phenomenon has been interpreted by the
self-stress theories in thin shells and plates [22–25]. However,
another anomalous phenomenon of hydrogen
transport has been found for 35 years, which has not attracted
much attention and which was misinterpreted in
past works. It is that the hydrogen pressure inside a tube
increases (or decreases) almost simultaneously with the
outer H2 gas pressure increasing (or decreasing) [13–
17,26], we call it super fast diffusion (SFD); it lasts a very
short time and appears before the UHD and Fickian diffusion
waves. However, this phenomenon does not occur
in processes of electrochemical charging and
discharging [5–12].

Hickman [26], Lewis and coworkers [13,14] have explained
the SFD as a result of external stress induced
by the outer pressure imposed during hydrogen charging
and it was named as ‘‘mechanically induced memory effects’’.
Although external stress does exists under gas
charging, our analysis indicates this effect is too small
to explain the SFD. On the other hand, the self-stress
theory for free-plates of metal–hydrogen system has
presented this effect [27], however, it cannot explain
other phenomena, e.g., UHD in electrochemical charging,
the time course of internal pressure change, and
the acceleration of permeation rate on interruption of
hydrogen charging [5–12].

In this paper, we will interpret the SFD by a thermokinetic
model. The reaction energy of hydrogen absorption
heats up the metallic tube and causes the tube wall
to desorb hydrogen at the downstream side; therefore
the pressure inside the tube increases at the beginning
of hydrogen charging. A similar process exists during
hydrogen discharging.


2. Model

Consider a vertical metallic tube with the bottom
sealed and the top connected to a glass tube [6,17],
which is open to a gauge for pressure measurement
as presented in Fig. 1. Similarly to previous works
[22,24], we use a one-dimensional model to simulate
the actual processes, the coordinate z is along the
thickness direction; the outer and inner surfaces of
the metallic tube wall (MTW) are at z = 0 and L,
respectively.

The stress in MTW is [22]:
Eq. (1), with
Eq. (2),
where nH is the atomic ratio of hydrogen to metal (M);
C0 is the concentration of H in M corresponding to
nH = 1, C0 = 0.113 mol cm 3 for Pd; VH is the partial
molar volume of H in M, VH = 1.6 cm3 for fcc metals
and alloys [28,29]; E and m are Young s modulus and
Poisson s ratio of the metal, respectively; r is the radius
of tube; pout and pin are the pressures outside and inside
the tube, respectively. The first term on the right-handside
of Eq. (1) is the self-stress produced by hydrogen
insertion [22]; the second term is caused by the external
static load (pressure difference here) on thin cylindrical
shells [30].

The hydrogen diffusion flux for the dilute solid-solution
phase of H in M has the form [22]:
Eq. (3), where D0 exp( Ea/RT) = D(T) is the diffusion coefficient
of H in M at temperature T in K, D0 and Ea are
the pre-exponential factor and activation energy, respectively,
and R is the molar gas constant.

Applying the mass balance condition to the flux
expression of Eq. (3) yields:
Eq. (4), with boundary conditions:
Eq. (5), where the input and output fluxes are expressed as:
Eq. (6) and 
Eq. (7), respectively. In Eqs. (6) and (7), k is the rate constant of
the M–H2 reaction: 1
2 nHH2 þM $ MHnH, DE is the
activation energy; nH and r take values just below the
surface (z = 0 or L); subscripts 0 and L are for z = 0
and L, respectively; subscripts + and   are for reactions
of hydrogen absorption and desorption, respectively. At
equilibrium, these two equations are equivalent to:
Eq. (8), with
Eq. (9) and
Eq. (10), where DH is the enthalpy change of the hydrogen
absorption reaction. Eqs. (6) and (7) are the simplest
expressions for the M–H2 reaction, steps of H2 molecules
adsorption and dissociation on the metal surface
and penetration of H atoms from the surface into the
bulk are incorporated into a single step. Eq. (8) is the
isotherm of hydrogen absorption by fcc metals or alloys
under stress r [4,7,29], bexp( DH/RT) is the Sieverts
parameter.

The pressure change inside the tube is:
Eq. (11), where T is the temperature of MTW and gas inside the
tube; p0 and T0 are initial values of p and T, respectively;
AM = 2prh is the area of MTW; h is the tube height; Vg
is the collection volume in which hydrogen gas is sealed.

The energy balance equation of the MTW is:
Eq. (12), where VM = 2prLh is the volume ofMTW; cM is the specific
heat of MTW, cM = 2.47 to 2.94 J cm 3 K 1 for Pd,
Ag and Pt, therefore, cM of their alloys used experimentally
[13–17] has a value around this range; a is the transfer
factor of thermal convection; eM is the total
emittance of metallic tube surface, we choose the value
of Pt black, eM = 0.91 [31], as that of Pd black coated
on the surface [13–17]; rS B = 5.67032 · 10 12 W cm 2
K 4, the Stefan–Boltzmann constant; rG, LG, 2prGLG
are radius, thickness and cross-section of glass tube wall
(GTW); jG is the thermal flux in the GTW near the top
of MTW (x = 0 in Fig. 1).

On the right-hand side of Eq. (12), the first term is the
heat power produced by exothermic reaction of hydrogen
absorption; the second one is the heat loss on surface
by natural convection; the third term is the radiation
power; the fourth term is the heat loss along the axial
direction by thermal conduction in the GTW. The isothermal
assumption within tube is used in Eq. (12) since
the relaxation time of thermal transport inMTWis much
less than that in GTW or that of hydrogen diffusion in
MTW. At the same time, thermostresses in MTW are
omitted because of the same reason.

The heat transfer factor in Eq. (12) has the form:
Eq. (13), with
Eq. (14) and
Eq. (15), where Nu and Ra are Nusselt and Rayleigh numbers,
respectively; constants c and n depend on the magnitude
of Ra [32], c = 1.18, n = 1/8 for 10 2 6 Ra < 104
and c = 0.54, n = 1/4 for 104 6 Ra < 109, there is no
value of Ra greater than 109 in this model; g is the
gravitational acceleration; gg is the absolute viscosity
of H2 gas; kg is the thermal conductivity of H2 gas;
qg is the density of H2 gas; cg is the specific heat of
H2 gas.

For convenience, quantities changing with temperature
and pressure in Eq. (15) are expressed as reduced
values relative to those at normal temperature and pressure
(25  C, 1 atm), thus we have [33]:
Eq. (16), 
Eq. (17), 
Eq. (18), where the quantities with the subscript N indicate the
values at normal temperature and pressure. The heat
convection in Eq. (12) can be expressed as
Eq. (19), with 
Eq. (20), where qg,N = 8.234 · 10 5 g cm 3, g = 979.75 cm s 2,
cg = 14.301 J g 1 K 1, hN = 1 cm, gg,N = 8.93 · 106 Pa
s, kg,N = 1.81 · 10 3 W cm 1 K 1. Therefore,
Cg = 5.12 · 10 3 W cm 2 K 1 for 10 2 6 Ra < 104 and
Cg = 5.62 · 10 3 W cm 2 K 1 for 104 6 Ra < 109. Combining
Eqs. (15)–(18) and above quantities, we have:
Eq. (21) for H2 gas.

The energy balance equation in GTW is
Eq. (22), with boundary conditions:
Eq. (23), where x is the coordinate along the axial direction as
shown in Fig. 1; aG = 3.4 · 10 3 cm2 s 1 and cG = 2.2 J cm 3 K 1 are the thermal diffusion coefficient and specific
heat of glass, respectively. a(T   T0) corresponds to
the thermal convection around GTW same as that in
Eqs. (12) and (19); the third term corresponds to the
radiation; eG = 0.94 is the total emittance of glass [31].

The initial condition is the homogenous distribution
of hydrogen concentration in MTW, equilibrium of
hydrogen chemical potential is reached between the solid
and gas phases before the initial time (t = 0), when
the external hydrogen pressure changes from p0 to p1
as presented in Fig. 1:
Eq. (24), where nH,0 corresponds to p0 and T0 according to
Eq. (8).

For comparison, we also discuss the situation of
electrochemical charging. The internal stresses and
boundary conditions are the same as before, the M–H2
surface process is replaced by the Pd–H electrode reaction
as treated earlier [22,24,34]; the only emphasized
point here is that the heat convection in Eqs. (12) and
(22) being replaced by
Eq. (25), with 
Eq. (26), where qw = 1 g cm 3, cw = 4.181 J g 1 K 1,
gw = 8.554 · 10 4 Pa s and kw = 6.104 · 10 3 W cm 1
K 1 at room temperature. Therefore, Cw = 7.62 · 10 2
W cm 2 K 1 for 10 2 6 Ra < 104 and Cw = 0.369 W
cm 2 K 1 for 104 6 Ra < 109. The corresponding Rayleigh
number is:
Eq. (27) for H2O.

In this work, we present results of a numerical procedure
reported earlier [34], where the various differential
equations are solved by a finite difference method. In the
calculation, the time step is 10 4 and the space step is
10 2, the precision is 104.


3. Results

An example of hydrogen gas charging process is
shown in Fig. 2. The initial and applied H2 pressures
correspond to nH = 0.145 and 0.545 at room temperature,
respectively; dimensions of MTW are taken from
[13–17]. From Fig. 2(a), we find that the internal pressure
changes simultaneously with outer pressure applied
and it increases firstly up to a maximum value then decreases
to a minimum less than the initial pressure because
of UHD, finally the internal pressure rise
monotonically. This physical picture is the same as
found experimentally [13–17].

There are three factors, the heat production and
loss, the self-stress and the concentration gradient of
H in M, competing and inducing the complicated
behavior of the pressure change. At the start, the
MTW absorbs hydrogen at upstream; this exothermic
reaction heats up the MTW as shown in Fig. 2(d).
The heated MTW desorbs hydrogen at downstream
in a very short initial time as illustrated in the insert
in Fig. 2(b). The temperature increase and output flux
together modify the internal pressure as indicated in
Eq. (11). For the maximum value of pressure change
in Fig. 2(a), contributions from temperature increment
and hydrogen desorption are 17% and 83%, respectively.
After some time, the heat dissipation exceeds
the heat production and the tube temperature begins
to decrease as presented in Fig. 2(c) and (d).

When the temperature increases slowly, the self-stress
effect dominates the kinetics of hydrogen transport. The
MTWabsorbs hydrogen through its inner surface as discussed
previously [22], therefore the direction of Jex
changes and the internal pressure decreases as shown
in Fig. 2(b) and (a), respectively. After an enough long
time, the flux wavefront of hydrogen interstitials reaches
the downstream, Fickian behavior dominates the transport
kinetics and the pressure increase monotonically
(see Fig. 2(a) and (b)).

Fig. 2(c) shows the heat dissipation and shares of different
contributions, the heat dissipation is proportional
to the temperature difference between the tube and environment
as expected. Although contributions from convection,
radiation and conduction vary with time in the
overall process, they approach stable values of 53%,
41% and 6% of the overall heat dissipation, respectively,
after a short initial time. These results also indicate that
the length of the glass tube does not affect the qualitative
characteristics of pressure change because the thermal
diffusion coefficient of glass is a negligible value.

Fig. 3 shows effects of initial and applied pressures on
SFD, it is found that the maximum amplitude of Dp/p0
in SFD decreases with p0 while p1 is fixed (see
Fig. 3(a)) because the corresponding hydrogen content
step on the outer surface decreases; however, the absolute
change of maximum Dp in SFD, Dpmax, has the
maximum value at p0 = 30.4 Torr as shown in the insert
in Fig. 3(a) and Dpmax may increase or decrease with p0
in different ranges of initial pressure as observed experimentally
[15]. The amplitude of Dp/p0 in SFD increases
with rising of p1 because the hydrogen content rises on
the outer surface as illustrated in Fig. 3(b) and demonstrated
experimentally [14].

heat production and dissipation, and parts of different contributions to heat dissipation; (d) temperature change of the metallic tube. The parameters
are: r = 0.4 cm, L = 0.04 cm, h = 7 cm; Vg = 23 cm3, p0 = 2 Torr, p1 = 100 Torr, T0 = 298.15 K; D0 = 1.5 · 10 3 cm2 s 1, Ea = 22 kJ mol 1,

Torr 1, b = 5 · 10 6 Torr 1/2, k0,  and kL,  are deduced from Eq. (9); cM = 2.7 J cm 3 K 1; aG = 3.4 · 10 3 cm2 s 1, cG = 2.2 Jcm 3 K 1; rGLG/
rL = 2, hG = 15 cm.

Fig. 4 shows effects of various parameters on the
SFD and UHD. Firstly, we discuss influences of the
heat transfer factor in natural convection. Because
Eq. (19) is only suitable for a vertical tube with infinite
length, it is applied here by using l/r = 17.5. We change
the value of Cg in Eq. (19) two times, i.e., the value of
Cg is 1/2 or 2 times of that in Eq. (20). It is found that
the qualitative characteristics are the same as Fig. 2(a)
because the convection is only a part of heat dissipation
as demonstrated in Fig. 2(c). The only difference
is the magnitude of SFD and UHD, this means that
a strong convection suppresses the SFD and enhances
the UHD.

Fig. 4(b) shows influences of the rate constant of the
outer surface reaction on the SFD and UHD. Low values
of the rate constant, which correspond to deactivated
outer surfaces of MTW, reduce the absorption
rate, changes of temperature and hydrogen concentration
in MTW remarkably. Therefore, effects of SFD
and UHD are not prominent. This conclusion is consistent
with experimental results, i.e., the SFD and UHD
only appear when sample surfaces are catalytically activated
by electrodeposition of palladium black [14]; otherwise,
it is difficult to observe both effects if the surface
is deactivated by immersions of sample in a solution of
I2 in KI [14].

Fig. 4(c) shows effects of the hydrogen diffusion coefficient
on the SFD and UHD. For large diffusion coefficients,
we find that the SFD is prominent and the UHD
may be concealed by the SFD as was shown by experimental
results [26]. Otherwise, the SFD disappears and
UHD is prominent while hydrogen diffusion coefficient
decreases due to the reaction heat has enough time to
dissipate.

Influences of the MTW thickness are similar to that
of the diffusion coefficient as shown in Fig. 4(d). For a
thin tube wall, the temperature rises drastically and
the UHD is concealed by the SFD; therefore, only tubes
with suitable thickness may exhibit both SFD and UHD
clearly.

Fig. 5 shows a trivial situation with initially hydrogen-
free wall (nH,0 = 0). We find that both SFD and
UHD phenomena all vanish as observed experimentally
[17], the only difference is that the diffusion is faster for
practical situation than the isothermal assumption.

In experiments, the SFD only appears in gas charging
processes and it has not yet been observed during electrochemical
charging [5–12]. To compare these two situations,
we simulate the electrochemical charging in Fig. 6
with the electrochemical reaction and boundary conditions
as discussed earlier [34].We find that the maximum
increment of temperature, DT/T0 = 4.73 · 10 3 is much
less than 3.57 · 10 2 in Fig. 2(d) by 7.5 times for the reason
that the heat loss is much faster for water than
hydrogen gas. Of course, there is a very small increment
of pressure, Dp/p0 = 2.75 · 10 3 after short time, D(T0)t/
L2 = 9.31 · 10 5 as shown in the insert in Fig. 6 and this
small SFD is generally neglected experimentally. Therefore,
only the UHD effect is prominent in electrochemical
charging experiments [5–12] and the SFD effect is
notable in gas charging processes [13–17].

Comparing Fig. 2(a) with Fig. 6, we find that the
hydrogen transport is generally faster in gas charging
than in electrochemical charging because of temperature
increasing. Similar difference occurs between the nonisothermal
and isothermal situations in Fig. 5. These results
mean that measured diffusion coefficients may be
greater than the actual one in charging process. It is also
indicated that the induced hydrogen concentration step
must be small enough in diffusion coefficient measurements
so that the heat release and self-stress effect are
not prominent; otherwise, the isothermal assumption is
not always satisfied.

The SFD has been associated with the net pressure
difference across the MTW [13,14,26]. To simulate this
effect, we consider an additional 100 Torr pressure of inert
gas (e.g., argon gas in [14]) being applied to the outer
surface of tube with initial H2 pressure of 2 Torr. It is
found that the MTW desorbs hydrogen and the internal
pressure increases under the external compressive stress
as expected, however, the maximum Dp/p0 is much smaller
than that in Fig. 2(a) by three orders of magnitude
and cannot match experimental results in [13–17]. Besides
the external-stress, another factor is the pure
mechanical effect, i.e., an external pressure makes the
MTW shrink and the internal volume Vg decrease, and
then the internal pressure increases. However, the maximum
amplitude of pressure change is less than that in
Fig. 2(a) by six orders of magnitude and this effect has
been verified experimentally using argon gas [14].

We also find that the SFD occurs in the hydrogen
desorption process as observed experimentally [13–17].
The physical picture is similar to that in charging processes
and it will not be discussed in detail.


4. Comparison with experimental results

In order to test the validity of the present treatment,
we compare the theoretical results with experimental
data. There is much evidence indicating the existence
of SFD [13–17,26], we chose one that has enough data
for our analysis as is plotted in Fig. 7. In this figure,
we use a simpler model than that in the above section,
the last term on the right-hand-side of Eq. (12) is removed
because GTWs contribution to heat loss is small
as shown in Fig. 2(c); and the heat transfer factor in
Eq. (12) takes a fixed value but not the form of Eq. (19) for convenience of comparison. We find that
the numerical results give good agreement with the
experimental data [14]. Because our model is a more
simplified one, many complicated factors are omitted;
therefore this comparison is only a guide to the eye
rather than based on the strict thermodynamic and kinetic
parameters measured experimentally.

Fig. 5. Effect of heat production on hydrogen diffusion with initial
condition of zero hydrogen content in the tube wall, the dash curve is
the result under the isothermal assumption. The parameters are the
same as those in Fig. 2 except the initial pressure of p0 = 0 Torr.

Fig. 6. An example of hydrogen absorption into a metallic tube during
electrochemical hydrogen charging under potentiostatic condition. The
parameters are the same as those in Fig. 2 except the convection heat
loss through H2 being replaced by that of H2O. For comparison, the
initial and applied electrode potentials induce the same nH values as
those of p0 and p1 in Fig. 2, respectively.

Of course, the present conclusion can be verified
experimentally by measurement of temperature of
MTW during hydrogen charging and/or discharging
processes. We hope our results can stimulate the interest
on this subject.


5. Discussion

For convenience, we deal with the heat dissipation
using a simplified form of Eq. (12). The term of heat
convection is only suitable for the steady state temperature
profile. For the non-steady state, heat convection
equations include temperatures of tube and environment,
distributions of density and velocity of gas, and
transports of mass and energy in the laminar area.
Although the results may differ quantitatively from here,
the physical picture should be the same as in this work.

For simplicity, our treatment is focused on the elastic
situation and the plastic deformation being accompanied
with large change of hydrogen concentration is
omitted. The plastic strain will affect the distribution,
concentration and transport of H in M and other properties.
We will discuss it in a forthcoming paper.

We only consider the ideal solid-solution of H in M,
the interaction between hydrogen atoms in metals and
alloys, which causes the enthalpy DH changing with
nH and emerging of a hydride phase, is neglected. This
non-ideality will lead to amplitudes of pressure change
and time interval being modified, however, the qualitative
characteristics of pressure change should be the
same as here.

Finally, although the present model is simple, it provides
the appropriate physical picture of hydrogen
transport in metals and alloys. At the same time, the
present treatment could be extended to other interstitials
in solid samples, e.g., lithium in Li-ion batteries, small
atoms and molecules in polymers, etc. Of course, effects
of enthalpy change and self-stress on other interstitial
transports depend on specific situations and must be
dealt with specifically.


6. Conclusion

Our model indicates that the pressure change during
hydrogen gas diffusion into a tube is a nonequilibrium
phenomenon induced by a combination of a chemical
reaction, self-stress, heat and mass transports. These
factors interact with each other and exhibit the super
fast diffusion and up-hill diffusion before the emergence
of Fickian diffusion. Appearances of super fast diffusion
or up-hill diffusion depend on some parameters, e.g. the
tube wall thickness, the surface activity, diffusion coefficient
of hydrogen in metals and heat transport parameters;
only appropriate parameter windows can exhibit all
of these phenomena simultaneously. Our results also
indicate that the isothermal assumption in the transport
experiments is not appropriate unconditionally.
