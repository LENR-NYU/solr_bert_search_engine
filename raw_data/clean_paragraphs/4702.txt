1. Introduction

In an earlier work [1], we discussed some problems on
the resistance measurement of palladium hydride to
determine the hydrogen content in it in situ. However,
we found recently that there are some mistakes in discussions
on the electrochemical effects in [1]. The expressions
of additional resistance caused by the
concentration-cell effect will induce non-physical pictures,
and some important factors were omitted. In this
paper, we will treat the electrochemical effects in a unified
manner. Similarly to the earlier paper, we focus only
on the direct current situation; the model and symbols
are the same as before [1] except as noted otherwise.


2. Model

The model for measurement of the resistance of a
PdjH electrode during electrolysis is the same as that in
Sections 3.5–3.7 and shown in Fig. 9 of [1]. Because
most of the mistakes appeared in discussions on the
concentration-cell effect of measurement and electrolysis
currents, we will discuss these in turn.

2.1. Co-conduction of electrolyte:
The co-conduction is the same as in Section 3.5.1 of
[1]. In addition, the current in the electrode for a measurement
current IM is equation
where RPdþH and RS are the resistances of the PdjH
electrode and electrolytic solution, respectively; values
of RS for different shapes of electrode were shown in Eq.
(41) of [1]. The corresponding potential drop across the
electrode is
DEM ¼ IM;PdþHRPdþH

2.2. Concentration-cell effect of measurement current:
This subsection corresponds to Section 3.5.2 in [1].
The potential balance equation for the concentrationcell
effect of the measurement current is equaion
where IM;C is the concentration-cell current in the electrode,
the other symbols are the same as before [1]. The
left-hand side of this equation is the electromotive force
of the concentration-cell relative to the point z ¼ l. The
first term in the right-hand side of this equation is the
ohmic polarization of the electrolytic solution and the
electrochemical overpotential (see Eqs. (49)–(54) in [1]);
the second term is the ohmic potential drop of the PdjH
electrode. This equation differs from Eq. (55) of [1] in
both sides; on one side, IM is replaced by IM;PdþH; on the
other, the range of integration of the ohmic polarization
of the PdjH electrode, i.e. 0 to z, is replaced by z to l.

Eq. (3) can be simplified to equation. The meaning of k is the same as that defined in Eqs.
(57)–(59) of [1]. Applying the boundary condition IM;C ¼ 0 at z ¼ 0
and l, we obtain the solution of Eq. (4). The potential drop across the PdjH electrode contributed
by the concentration-cell effect of the measurement
current is Eq. (5). By comparison with Eqs. (64) and (65) in [1], we find
they are different. The divergence of DEM;C at
k ¼ p; 2p; 3p; . . . in Eq. (64) of [1] is avoided, the function
1   2 tanhðk=2Þ=k increases with k and approaches
1 when k is large enough as expected; however, its primary
approximation, k2=12, is the same as before and
the physical pictures of Fig. 10 in [1] are qualitatively
correct.

2.3. Collection effect of electrolysis current:
This subsection corresponds to Section 3.6.1 in [1].
Provided that the counter electrode is far away from the
PdjH electrode and the electrolysis current is collected at
the point z ¼ l as shown in Fig. 9(b) of [1], the potential
at a point z is composed of the overpotential, and the
ohmic potential drops of solution and electrode resistances.
We can obtain a relationship similar to Eq. (3)
constant = Eq. (7).
where IE;PdþH is the current collected in the PdjH electrode
during electrolysis with current IE In this equation,
the polarization resistance is the same as that in Eq. (3)
because we consider only the shift of overpotential and
solution resistance at a point from the average values
over the whole electrode, which are included in the lefthand
side of Eq. (7). Eq. (7) can be simplified to Eq. (8). Applying the boundary condition: IE;PdþH ¼ 0 at z ¼ 0
and IE;PdþH ¼ IE at z ¼ l, we obtain the solution Eq. (9).

In the primary approximation, it is a linear distribution
as was supposed before [1]. The electrolysis current
density is Eq. (10). where jE;PdþH is a constant in the primary approximation
as indicated in Eq. (68) of [1]. The potential drop across
the PdjH electrode contributed by the collection of the
electrolysis current is Eq. (11). In the zero order approximation, it is IERPdþH=2 as indicated
in Eq. (71) of [1].

2.4. Concentration-cell effect of electrolysis current:
This subsection corresponds to Section 3.6.2 in [1].
Similarly to Eq. (3), we have Eq. (12). Utilizing Eq. (9), we can simplify Eq. (12) to Eq. (13). Applying the boundary condition IE;C ¼ 0 at z ¼ 0 and l,
we obtain the solution of Eq. (13).
The potential drop across the PdjH electrode caused by
the concentration-cell effect of the electrolysis current is Eq. (15).
This equation differs from Eq. (77) in [1]; however, their
primary approximations are the same and Fig. 11 in [1]
is appropriate when k is small.


3. Results and discussion

Combining Eqs. (2), (6), (11) and (15), we obtain the
overall potential drop across the PdjH electrode while
the measurement current IM is applied during electrolysis
with current IE, Eq. (16). The apparent resistance can be expressed as Eq. (17). Applying Eq. (1), we obtain the series expansion of Eq.
(17) Eq. (18). From this equation, we find that there are three parameters,
RPdþH=RC; RPdþH=RS and IE=IM, influencing the
measured value of the electrode resistance. For convenience, we illustrate their effects for a straight rod electrode
(shape I in Fig. 9(a) of [1]); the dimensionless
parameters RPdþH=RC and RPdþH=RS are Eq. (19) and Eq. (20) respectively. On the whole, the above measurement errors
with different origins can be expressed by four dimensionless
quantities, IE=IMl=r0; qPdþH=qS and r0f qSj0C: Eq. (21). The corresponding numerical results are shown in
Fig. 1.

First of all, it is found that the contribution of the
electrolysis process to resistance measurements depends
on the direction and magnitude of the electrolysis current
as shown in Fig. 1(a). If IE=IM > 0, it will contribute
a positive shift to the measured resistance. Otherwise, it
will diminish the magnitude of the measured value while
IE=IM < 0. This is the reason for the delta-mode current
being utilized to cancel out the electrolysis contribution
in the experiments given in [2,3] and discussed previously
[1]. However, the period of the delta current must
be much less than the diffusion time of hydrogen along
the radial direction; otherwise, concentration-cell effects
of the measurement current also exist.

Fig. 1(b) illustrates the effects of l=r0 When l=r0 is
small, Rappa increases with l=r0 because the concentration-
cell effect increases with increasing l=r0 as indicated
by Eqs. (17) and (19). However, the co-conduction of
electrolyte will dominate the resistance measurement
while l=r0 is enough large as indicated by Eqs. (17), (19)
and (20). For an electrolyte with large conductance, the
co-conduction effect is prominent and its concentrationcell
effect is relatively small.

Fig. 1(c) shows dependences of Rappa on r0f qSj0C This
indicates that the electrode diameter, temperature,
electrolyte conductance, electrode roughness and exchange
current density of the electrode reaction all affect
Rappa. An electrode with a rough surface results in a
large value of j0V hence large values of j0C. At the same
time, some additives such as H2S and thiourea can inhibit
the reaction rate of the PdjH electrode, so it is easy
to understand that they can diminish Rappa as was observed
experimentally [4–6]. Another factor is the electrolysis
current density; a large magnitude of electrolysis
current density results in high values of j0C and Rappa as
the effect of j0V. When r0fSj0C is small enough, the
concentration-cell effect can be neglected, but the coconduction
effect is prominent especially while the solution
conductance is large.

Fig. 1 also shows that the resistivity ratio qPdþH=qS
has the most important effect. If qPdþH=qS < 10 6, it has
only a slight influence on Rappa with other parameters
being fixed; otherwise, the additional resistance may not
be neglected.

For the electrodes with shapes of W and U in
Fig. 9(a) of [1], Rappa=RPdþH depends dW=r0 and dU=r0
respectively, besides the four dimensionless parameters
indicated in Eq. (21). Their apparent resistances differ
from that of shape I mainly by the co-conduction effect
because RPdþH=RS depends more strongly on the shape
of the electrode than RPdþH=RC with the same length and
radius as indicated by Eqs. (41), (50), (57)–(59) in [1].
This means the apparent resistance has the maximum
value for shape I.

Although our treatments are focused on the PdjH
electrode, the main conclusions can be extended to other
metal (and/or alloy) hydride electrodes with some parameters
modified. On the other hand, the actual samples
may be spheres, plates and other shapes but not
cylinders, as here, the apparent resistance must be calculated
specifically. However, the qualitative aspects are
the same as here. Finally, the present results are mainly
theoretical; the qualitative aspects are consistent with
available experiments [4–6]. The quantitative verifications
need to be carried out in future experimental work.
