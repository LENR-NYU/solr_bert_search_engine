(I)THE NEW SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS, THE(law of Coup I ing) = (LOC)

In article(lOL the first law was used to prove
the qualitative existence of entropy S ( dS = O,
when oQR = 0) without knowing the dS equation.
This makes it possible to establish a new second
law of thermodynamics,the Law Of Coupling(LOC) [1]
[2],which states: 
'It is impossible for a simple system to approach a high
entropy state from a low
entropy one with evolution
of heat at the same time!
.....(Liu' s LOC)

This statement is identical with( ) its 3 branches
(I) (II) (III) and 5 small branches as shown by (Liu' s
Branch Theory of LOC), Equation (I-1) wherein P

Cold Nuclear Fusion belongs to LOC (I-1). (CNF) is an EXOTHERMIC PROCESS with ENTROPY DECREASE.

Entropy S is an extensive function, its value is proportional to the number of mo I es (n): n= 2 for the
reactants(A+B); and n= l for the product AB with mass
defect.

(II)DISSIPATION CRITERIA FOR COLD NUCLEAR FUSION(CNF): It was proved by using LOC for the process of
irreversible charging of an electric cell: This is the first two laws of thermodynamics for this
irreversible cell process wherein: The meaning of the above two equations is: 
In the process of charging, the work input to the cell, A' is converted into the increase of free energy.

Equation(II-4) seems to explain the experimental facts published by some authors. However, more experiments are seriously needed, especially the
method of experiment and treatment of the results
need serious considerations.
