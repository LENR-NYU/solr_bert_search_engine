Experiment: 

Electrodes (Pd, Nb, Ta or other metal) were fixed to both ends of a glass reaction bulb. The
thickness of the glass wall of bulb was 2.0 ± 0.2mm, the voltage V and current I of discharge were
4-l 8KV, l-50mA(50Hz) respectively: The pressure of discharge gas (02, H2, air, Ar••·) was dynamic (flowing) low pressure(< 100Pa).

The x-ray measurement system was composed of a high pure Ge detector (G MX200) made in
ORTEC company of U.S.A., a pulse shape analyser (CANBERRA, 2160A) and a IBM-PC/XT
computer. The detector sensitive volume was 102 cm3, the measuring range was 5 KeV to l.64Mev,
the relative efficiency is 20%. The Ge detector was placed in a lead shielded cabin so that the background was 10~ l lcounts / sec within 24 to 4096 channels. We used 152Eu and 241Am source to calibrate the energy Ex and detection efficiency ci of x-ray detector, the results were described as table
1, the error and the drift of energy during a week was less than 0.5KeV. 

Using different thickness (L) metal attenuator (Cu, Al, Cd foil), the (µ I p)(Ex) of source x-ray
could be obtained, it was consistent with the standard value [2] (error~ 15%). In air discharge there 
was not anomaly of x-ray. 


Results: 

There were some anomalous phenomenon in many energy spectrums of x-ray, table 2-5 described the typical spectrums, there were high energy x-ray; in the energy interval Ex I (..f2ev )
= 3~ 20 (V denoted alternating voltage, e denoted electron charge), the intensities of x-ray were
10% ~ 1000% of background. To test the character of x-ray, we used different thickness {L) metal
attenuating foil (Cu, Al, Pb, Cd foil) in front of the detector, the mass attenuation cross section 
(µ I p)(Ex) might be obtamed (see table 6-9): µ/p = 1/p(L1-L2), N1(Ex), N2(Ex) were the Intensities of x-ray of energy Ex as metal attenuating foil of thickness L1, L2was
used respectively. N0 (Ex) was the Intensities of background, p was the density of metal foil. In Comparison with the standard value (µ I p) • of handbook [2], (µ I p) was very different: at low energy
( <20KeV) (µIp) I(µ Ip)• � 0.01 ~0.5, at high energy (> 30KeV) (µIp) I(µ Ip). � 2~ 100, for
some energy spectrums (µ/ p) might be negative at some energy interval, and (µ/ p) depended not
only Ex and atomic number Z (as standard value (µ Ip)•) but also V,L···. 

In some special cases (table 10), as L1 > L2, the corresponding total count rate of x-ray L 1 > L i([ = dE x dE x ). So the average effective attenuation cross section ( lg[(L 1-2'. 0) / (L 2-r o)l / p(L1-L2)) was negative. It was very anomalous. 

For reducing the electromagnetic disturbance effect upon measuring result, some steps were
adopted. In short time interval (100~ 300sec) only changing the thickness L, the change of energy
spectrum and intensity of x-ray was regular (not random) and might be repeated. This meant the
counts of x-ray were not affected by electromagnetic disturbance obviously. For check and comparison, we also applied thcrmoluminesccn t dosimeters (TLD) and Nal detector to measurement of
x-ray dose, TLD was not affected by electromagnetic noise. Using Pb attenuation foil of 5mm
thickness , TLD recorded the intensity of 4 times background; Using Pb attenuation foil of 1,2,6mm
thickness simultaneously, the discharge voltage was 14kV, TLD recorded the intensity of 77.6, 35.1,
8.6 mR (milli Rongcn) respectively, the background was about 2.4 mR. So we might obtain the average mass attenuation cross section: (µIp)= 0.734(1 ~ 2rnm),0.367(2~ 6mm)cm2 I g, the corresponding x-ray energy was 214 keV and 277 kcV, this strongly supported above measuring results
about there were 100~ 300keV high energy x-ray in the low voltage gas (D2,Hi) discharge.


Analysis and discussion 
From above measuring results. we might think that the x-ray emission spectrum N(Ex) included two parts: N(E ) = N n(E ) + N a(E ), N n(x) was the normal x-ray of gas discharge, or calx X X
led beam-target x-ray, Na(Ex) was anomalous part, according to our supposition [3], some
quasis table compact small deuterium (hydrogen) atom or molecule (denoted by De•, Pc•
De• De•, Pe• Pc•, D denoted deuterium nucleus, P was proton, c • was electron) Could be produced
in the low voltage gas discharge, the dimension R of De•, Pc• was much more less than Bohr radius
RB, R / RBmight be 0.01 ~ 0.1 or less, so De•, Pc• could penetrate thick metal foil and interact with
metal atom, when it broke up very nearby the nucleus of metal atom, the electron was accelerated by
Coulomb field of nucleus, and x-ray were emitted, because electron might move very nearby nucleus
and Z > > 1, so high energy x-ray could be emitted. In metal attenuation foil on the one hand x-ray
were absorbed (mainly was photoelectric absorption), and on the other hand, x-ray were produced 
simultaneously, in the result negative absorption might appear. 

Supposing the current of quasi stable compact small neutral particle (De• ,Pe•,···) was n0, its
attenuation cross section was tX(ro), it depended some parameters m (for example: radius, energy•··),
the attenuation of neutral particle current in metal foil accompanied the emission of new x-ray: We
might obtain the expression.

G(m) was the distribution function of small neutral particle, g(m,Ex) was the distribution function of
emitting x-ray when the neutral particle of ro-characteristic was attenuated. X denoted the thickness
of metal attenuation foil. 

In low energy, Nn(Ex) and Na(Ex) both contributed to x-ray emission spectrum N(Ex)
effectively (in many cases, Nn(Ex) might be main), But in high energy interval, or when the metal
attenuation foil attenuated the low energy x-ray to very great extent, then the measuring x-ray was
Na(Ex) mainly, the character of Na(Ex) was represented by factor S(x) mainly S(x) = e x -e/ ll(w) - µ(E ) 

The value of S(x) was maxim un at x m = lg[µ(E x) I tX(m )] I [µ(Ex) - tX(ro )]. as L1 < L2< xm,
N a(Ex,L1) < N a(Ex,L2), so the negative absorption might appear.

In summary, because the existence of Na(Ex,x), above anomalies of x-ray might be explained
qualitatively. 

In future, we should discriminate Nn(x) and Na(x) in detail, research the character of Na(x) and
test the existence of quasi stable compact small neutral particle directly.
