1 Introduction

After the successful public demonstrations of excess heat in Pd|D2O+H2SO4
electrolytic cells at Boston (ICCF10) in 2003 [1,2], we confirmed this anomalous effect
using a more accurate calorimeter: a Seebeck Envelope Calorimeter (SEC). The SEC is a
cube; the electrolysis cell is placed inside it. The SEC converts the heat flux through the
six walls of the cube into a voltage signal using many thermocouples distributed
uniformly in the walls. Many problems of isoperibolic calorimetry and mass flow
calorimetry can be avoided by this method [3,4].

In this report we present the calorimetric results for the Pd|D2O+H2SO4 electrolytic
cell, results with Ti added to the D2O+H2SO4 electrolyte, and the results of analysis of the
Pd cathodes.


2 Experimental set-up

Closed cells are similar to that used before [1,2] except that the height is less in order
to fit into the SEC as shown in Fig. 1(a) and described below. The electrolytic cell is a
Pyrex cylinder (capacity is about 280 ml, in = 50.7 mm and out = 57.0 mm, wall
thickness = 3.2 mm, h = 142 mm). A PTFE female top cap is 65 mm × 20 mm outside
dimensions and 57 mm × 16 mm of inside. It has two holes, 0.5 mm diameter each, for
the electrode lead wires. A PTFE plate (50 mm × 8 mm) is used to suspend the
recombination catalyst above the electrode. It has many holes of 0.8 mm, and also has
two holes, 1 mm diameter each, for the electrode lead wires. A PTFE rod is fastened to
the perforated plate and the top cap ensures that the perforated plate is at a fixed distance
above the electrolyte. A gasket (in = 35 mm, out = 57 mm, wall thickness = 2.5 mm)
made of ethylene propylene (resistant to sulfuric acid) is used to seal the top cap against
the top edge of Pyrex cylinder.

The Pd cathode is cut from a 99.9% palladium foil with 0.5 × 10 × 10 mm3 (Alfa
Aesar, Stock #11514). It is then cold rolled to the desired thickness. The platinum anode
is a foil 37.5 × 23.8 × 0.12 mm3. Pt leads are made of wire (1 mm × 150 mm) covered
with heat-shrink Teflon tube.

The electrolyte is heavy water (99.9 at.%, Aldrich catalog #347167) mixed with
96.4% H2SO4 (J.T. Baker, Lot # K10030) by the volume ratio of 6.7:1.

Two types of catalyst were used in these experiments, one contains 0.5% Pd on
coconut charcoal (United Catalysis); another contains 0.5% Pt on 1/8 inch diameter
alumina pellets (Alfa Aesar). Before each experiment, the catalyst was thoroughly dried in
an oven at 88C in order to drive out the liquid adsorbed during previous electrolysis.

A schematic of the calorimetry system is shown in Fig. 1(b). The SEC (Thermonetics
Corp.) has inner dimensions of 18.3 18.3 18 cm3 (W D H). A fan (Panaflo®,
Model FBA08A12H1A, 80 80 25.5 mm3, DC12 V, 173 mA, 2.08 W) is used to
eliminate temperature gradients in the SEC [3]. The temperature of the SEC wall (TSEC
wall) is controlled by a constant temperature bath (NESLAB, RTE-111); the temperature
stability is 0.1C. The SEC is covered with Styrofoam to avoid the influences of room
temperature fluctuations on calorimetry.

An HP 6267B DC power supply (0 to 40 V, 0 to 10 A) is used for galvanostatic
electrolysis. The electrolysis current is measured with a shunt resistor, which is a standard
resistor of 0.1 with 0.04% precision (Leed & Northrup 4360). The electrolytic cell is
placed in the center of the SEC. Eight K-type thermocouples are used to monitor
temperatures: one is for ambient temperature outside the SEC; one is for air temperature
in the SEC; two are attached on the outside of the cell wall at the middle height of
electrolyte; four are attached on the wall at the middle height of catalyst. All data are
monitored by a Keithley 2000-20+scan digital multimeter. The data are automatically
logged every minute using TestPoint 3.3 software.

The mass of the cell was measured before and after electrolysis using a My Weigh
i500 balance (max. 500 g, d = 0.1 g). After Jan 1, 2005 this was replaced with an Ohaus
D54 balance (max. 2000 g, d = 0.01 g). The Pd sample is weighed with a Mettler H70
(max. 160 g, d = 0.01 mg).

Calibration experiments are conducted using a Pt|H2O+H2SO4 electrolysis cell, a pure
resistor, or a dummy cell with a resistor in it. Calibrations are carried out before and after
every electrolysis experiments.

Surface topography and element analysis of the palladium cathode surface is
performed using an ISI-SS40 scanning electron microscope (SEM) with an attached
Oxford model 5565 energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS).


3 Results

3.1. Calorimetric results: Firstly, we present calibration results. A resistor provided by the SEC manufacturer
was placed at the center of the SEC. TSEC wall was the same as that used for the
experimental Pd|D2O electrochemical cell calorimetry. After the calorimeter reached
steady state with the fan turned on, the background signal was stable. Then, power was
applied to the resistor. After the output signal reached steady state, the power was turned
off. The output signal was monitored during the cool down. The device constant is the
quotient of average stable input power to the average net output signal at steady state. The
net output signal is the gross output signal minus the signal produced by the power
supplied to the fan. For input power of 11 W, the fan power decreases by 23 ± 3 mW (1.4
%) during calibration or calorimetry. The decrease in fan power during calibration is the
same magnitude as the decrease during calorimetry, so there should be no net effect on
the calculated excess power. One calibration requires about 12 hours.

Figure 2(a) shows the results of one of the calibration experiments. It gave the device
constant of 182.34 0.20 W/V. The time constant is 15 minutes here. Due to the large
inner volume (6 liter), the time constant of the SEC is mostly determined by the heat
capacity and conductivity of the sample under test, rather than the SEC itself.

Figure 2. (a) An example of calibration (Exp. No. 051005); (b) calibrations at different input power, where 2
is the sum of squared residuals; R2 is the coefficient of determination (Exp. No. 041228).

Calibrations were performed at input power ranging from about 1 to 20 W. In this
range, the device constant changes only slightly, as shown by the equations in Fig. 2(b).
This means that the SEC behaves as an ideal calorimeter. The slight non-linear term of the
device constant with increasing power is caused by the nonlinear increase in
electromotive force produced by the SEC thermocouples. However the device constant
varies. For example, there were 11 calibration runs during December 2005. The device
constant ranged from 180.6 to 181.8 W/V, a variation of less than 1%. The before-andafter
calibrations for an experiment typically give device constants which differ by less
than 0.5%. The actual device constant used for calculating the excess power and energy is
the average value of those obtained before and after the electrolysis with the same power
input as that used in electrolysis.

Besides the resistor, a Pt|H2O+H2SO4 electrolytic cell or a dummy cell with a resistor
in it was also used to calibrate the SEC. Both of these cells have the same dimensions as
that used for Pd|D2O+H2SO4 electrolysis; this arrangement could exclude the errors
induced by the difference between temperature distributions of working cell and
calibration resistor. The results showed that those three different calibrations gave the
same device constant within experimental error.

Seven Pd samples have been tested in experiments; four of them gave reproducible
excess heat. The calorimetric results for the best sample, Pd-A, are presented here in
detail. The sample Pd-A (9.0 × 37.2 × 0.35 mm3, total area of 7.08 cm2, weight 1.3418 g)
was cold rolled from 0.5 mm to 0.35 mm thickness. One example of excess heat
production and related parameters are shown in Fig. 3.

Fig. 3(a) shows that the power input decreases rapidly in the first two hours because
the input power heats the cell, as shown in Fig. 3(b); therefore the electrolyte conductivity
increases and overvoltages on the two electrodes decrease with time. These factors make
the cell voltage decrease correspondingly.

Another phenomenon is that the catalyst temperature (indirectly measured on the
outer wall of the cell) has some fluctuation possibly because of the coarse grains of
charcoal (about 2 3 6 mm3) and the inhomogeneous properties of the solid/gas
reaction. Fine particles of catalyst produced by pulverizing the large grains can improve
the stability and uniformity of temperature. However this method does not improve the
catalysis and it makes the catalyst more difficult to handle.

0.032 W (without including mass loss) to 1.273 ± 0.065 W (including mass loss of 0.9 g). (b) An example of
heat bursts during excess power production in Exp. No. 041122.

Part of the water produced by the recombination of oxygen and deuterium gases is
adsorbed by the catalyst. The fraction of the water adsorbed depends on electrolysis
current and time, and the temperature and activity of the catalyst. It is from 40% to 80%
in our experiments.

Heat bursts have been observed from sample Pd-A, in addition to the stable excess
heat, in three different experiments. One example is shown in Fig. 4(b).

The excess heat was measured at different SEC wall temperatures; one set of results
is shown in Table 1 and Fig. 5. We have conducted calorimetry with TSEC wall at 40C,
which causes the electrolyte temperatures to approach boiling. Therefore the mass loss is
great due to the evaporation increase at higher temperature, and the excess power
calculation is not accurate. Therefore, the highest temperature listed here is 35C.

Figure 5. Dependence of excess power on temperature of SEC wall for Sample Pd-A, the current is 3 A (the
corresponding current density is 0.42 A cm2); the input power is 11 to 13 W.

Beside the dependence of excess power on temperature, the excess power is
proportional to the current density up to at least 0.5 A cm2 as illustrated in Table 2 and
Fig. 6. Our set-up now cannot identify the excess power at higher current more than 4 A
because the catalyst cannot recombine all of the off gases produced by higher currents.
These results also agree with the reported behavior of excess power found as early as
1989 [5].

Figure 6. Dependences of excess power on current density for sample Pd-A (Exp. No. 041115).

From October 2004 to November 2005, we have conducted electrochemical
calorimetry on Pd|D2O+H2SO4 systems for 7 Pd samples; the results are summarized in
Table 3. In the 7 samples, sample Pd-A, Pd-E and Pd-F gave excess heat in 70% of the
experiments with Ti in the electrolyte. Pd-F uses two almost identical cells with Pd
cathodes connected in series. Sample Pd-B produced excess heat in the first experiment
only. Samples Pd-C and Pd-D have never given any excess heat.

The electrolyte used for samples Pd-A and Pd-B was electrolyte previously used for
Ti|D2O+H2SO4 electrolysis. Therefore, some titanium was dissolved in the electrolyte [7].
To identify the effects of titanium additive on the excess heat, we dissolved titanium in
electrolyte from experiments involving sample Pd-D. Its effects on excess heat are also
shown in Table 3. The concentration of titanium is expressed by the mass of titanium per
unit volume of electrolyte. The data in Table 3 indicate that titanium in the electrolyte
enhances excess heat production [7].

3.2. Scanning electron microscopy measurements:
We analyzed Pd sample surfaces before and after electrolysis, and we found changes
in the characteristic X-ray spectra. In particular Pd Lβ/Lαratio is higher on the Pd
cathode after electrolysis. As noted previously this may be due to the occurrence of silver
after electrolysis [2], because Ag Lαoverlaps with Pd Lβ. For comparison, we present the
blank results firstly. Fig. 7 shows the SEM and corresponding characteristic X-ray
spectrum with an EDS for a Pd sample before electrolysis. We find the surface is very
smooth and the Pd Lβ/Lαratio is 0.41, compared with 0.42, the ratio expected for pure
Pd.

Figure 8 shows the surface pictures of sample Pd-A after electrolysis for 429 hours.
The cathode bends towards the anode during electrolysis as observed previously [6]. The
photo and SEM picture both indicate that the Pd electrode is covered with a deposit. The
EDS results of Table 4 show that this deposit is mostly Pt, which dissolves from the
anode.

Figure 9 shows part of the characteristic X-ray spectrum from the dark spot S2 in Fig.
8(b). Spot S2 is from a hole in the surface. It should be the bare Pd surface. Bright spot
S3 is at the edge of the hole, where the Pt is deposited. It seems likely that the holey
regions are places where palladium-deuterium electrode reactions occur after some time
electrolysis. Fig. 9 shows an increase in Pd Lβ/Lα. Using deconvolution software, it is
found that S2 has 6.5 atomic% Ag and S3 has no Ag. Other results in our group show that
Pd Lβ/Lαmay be 1 or greater on the Pd cathode after electrolysis in heavy water. This is
convincing evidence of the presence of localized concentrations of Ag [7].

Besides sample Pd-A, we also measured silver on other Pd samples after electrolysis. Another example is shown in Figure 10 and Table
5; this sample also produced excess heat. Because the results are qualitatively the same as those of sample Pd-A, we will not discuss them in
detail.


Discussion and Conclusion

Our SEC calorimetric results showed that excess heat is produced in a Pd|D2O+H2SO4 electrolytic cell, thus confirming the positive
results obtained by isoperibolic calorimetry. The excess heat was qualitatively reproducible for some samples. Ti additions to the electrolyte
improved reproducibility of excess heat, possibly by depositing on the cathode and catalyzing reactions which produce excess heat.
Localized changes in the surface topography of the Pd cathodes correlate with changes in the characteristic X-ray peaks of Pd. As before,
these are interpreted in terms of localized concentrations of Ag, which is thought to be produced during electrolysis.
