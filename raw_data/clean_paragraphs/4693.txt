1. Introduction

It is verified experimentally that the anomalous excess heat production in the Pd|D2O
electrolytic system depends on the D/Pd ratio, the space gradient of deuterium concentration
and cell temperature etc. [1-3]. However, because not all of these variables are orthogonal, it
is necessary to establish their dependent relation in further research. One of these relations is
the loading ratio as a function of temperature [4-8]. Mengoli et al have found that the loading
ratio of D in Pd, xD decreases with temperature by a slope of ¶xD/¶T ~ - 1.1 ´ 10 - 3 K-1 under
the potentiostatic charging condition in the temperature range from 25 °C to 90 °C [4]. The
same group have also found that ¶xH/¶T ~ - 1.6 ´ 10 - 3 K -1 under the galvanostatic charging
condition and ¶xH/¶T ~ - 8.7 ´ 10-4 K-1 under the potentiostatic charging condition with the
H3PO4 electrolyte from 25 °C to 175 °C [6]. In addition, Asami et al found that ¶xD/¶T ~ -
2.0 ´ 10-3 K-1 from 25 °C to 80 °C [8]. Although these temperature effects can be explained
qualitatively by the thermodynamics of Pd+H(D) system [9] and the kinetics of the hydrogen
evolution reaction (HER) [10-13], the quantitative analysis is absent up to now. In this paper,
we will deal with this subject in detail.


2. Model

Consider hydrogen absorption into a PdHx electrode in the HER (taken to include D, the
same below). At the outer surface, there are three steps, i.e. the Volmer, Tafel and penetration
reactions taking place at the same time [10,11]. The rate of the Volmer step is the applied
current density (CD) and the rate of the Tafel step is:
Eq. (1). Because the penetration reaction is very rapidly, it is in pseudo-equilibrium [11] and we
have the isotherm:
Eq. (2).
In Eqs. (1) and (2), A+T and A-T are the Arrhenius frequency factors of the rate constant for
H2 dissociation and H combination reactions; E+T and E-T are the corresponding activation
energies; Ub is the non- ideal interaction energy of H in the bulk of the b-PdHx, Ub = 44.9
kJ mol- 1 for both H and D [9]; Us is the heterogeneity energy of the Frumkin adsorption,
its value depends on the additives in the electrolyte and pH value; f is the fugacity of H2
gas; x is the H/Pd atomic ratio; r is the surface roughness factor; Gs = 2.2 ´ 10 - 9 mol H cm
- 2, is the maximum H molar number of available sites per real unit area; q is the fractional
surface coverage of H on Pd. The other symbols have their usual meanings.


3. Results

3.1. Equilibrium state:
Prior to detailed discussing the situation of HER, we focused on the equilibrium state. To
be specific, the electrode reaction is confined to the normal condition of f = 1 atm and 0 °C £
T £ 100 °C. The first assumption means that the partial pressure of hydrogen is equal to that
of circumstance, this can be realized through carrying out experiment under H2 gas
atmosphere or blowing hydrogen gas from the bottom of cell. Although many experiments are
employed without the blowing H2 gas and the initial state differs from this equilibrium state,
the hydrogen bubbles produced in the HER makes the H partial pressure is approximately
equal to 1 atm, hence the corresponding equilibrium state is the same as that in the hydrogen
atmosphere. These choices of pressure and temperature ensure the Pd+H system is in the
b-phase in equilibrium or in the HER.

We can obtain the exchange CD (per real unit area) of the Tafel reaction as a function of T.
Contrary to one’s expectatio n, it is the weak adsorption rather than the strong adsorption
dominates the H absorption into the b-PdHx electrode as verified experimentally and
theoretically [10-12]. Therefore, the Frumkin adsorption reduces to the Langmuir type with
Usq® 0 and 1 - q® 1. The exchange CD of the Tafel step is:
Eq. (3) with E0T = 2DHgs + E-T, is the apparent activation energy of j0T, and it was observed that E0T =
27 kJ mol - 1 in 0.5 M H2SO4 [10]; DHgs is the adsorption enthalpy of H on Pd.

It is easy to obtain the relationship between the hydrogen pressure and the loading ratio
using Eq. (2) and the equilibrium result of Eq. (1):
Eq. (4) with DSgb = DSsb + R/2 ln(A+T/ A-T) and DHgb = DHsb + (E+T - E-T)/2. This equation is exactly
the isotherm of H absorption into the b-PdHx, it is found that DSgb = - 53.5 and - 53.1 J mol-
1 K -1, and DHgb = - 50.1 and – 47.7 kJ mol - 1 for H and D, respectively. Although changes of
entropy and enthalpy in each step may be influenced by the Pd surface property or solution
composition, their sums must be constant values as are indicated by Eq. (4). The loading ratio
changing with temperature under a fixed pressure is:
Eq. (5) which is - 1.0 ´ 10 - 3 K - 1 for both H and D in Fig. 1, the curve j = 0. These curves are the
isobar of H(D) absorption into the b-PdHx (PdDx) under 1 atm pressure.

3.2. Fast Volmer-slow Tafel mechanism:
Because there are two mechanisms of the HER, i.e. the fast Volmer-slow Tafel type at low
CD in acidic solution and coupled Volmer-Tafel type in basic solution or at high CD in acidic
solution, taking place on the Pd electrode, we will discuss the steady-state absorption in these
two situations successively. For the first mechanism, the Tafel step is irreversible and the
Volmer reaction is in pseudo-equilibrium, the value of q is small and the adsorption can be
simplified to the Langmuir type as in discussion about j0T. Substituting Eq. (2) into Eq. (1)
gives:
Eq. (6) which describes x as a function of j. Hence we obtain the loading ratio changing with
temperature:
Eq. (7) which is - 1.2 ´ 10 - 3 K - 1 for H and - 1.5 ´ 10 - 3 K - 1 for D in Fig. 1.

3.3. Coupled Volmer-Tafel mechanism: Consider the HER is far from equilibrium, both the Volmer and Tafel steps are completely
irreversible. The adsorption is the Frumkin type at intermediate surface coverage, this means
the exponent term is prominent in the hydrogen adsorption isotherm. Eliminating the factor
exp(Usq/RT) between Eqs. (1) and (2) gives:
Eq. (8), this equation describes the relation between j and x. We can obtain the loading ratio changing
with T:
Eq. (9) which is - 2.4 ´ 10 - 3 K - 1 for H and - 2.7 ´ 10 - 3 K - 1 for D in Fig. 1. In the deduction, the
contribution originated from the term q(1-q) is omitted as it is a slowly varying quantity.

Fig. 1 shows x changing with T based on Eqs. (1) and (2) under the galvanostatic charging
condition. The related parameters, noted in the caption of Fig.1, result in q0 = 0.01 and j0T =
0.01 mA cm- 2 at 298.15 K. These choices ensure the adsorption in equilibrium is weak; the
HER is along the fast Volmer-slow Tafel mechanism while - j £ 1 mA cm- 2 or the coupled
Volmer-Tafel mechanism while - j >> 1 mA cm- 2 around the ambient temperature. The
activation energies are chosen to ensure that E0T = 27 kJ mol- 1, DHgb = - 50 kJ mol- 1 for H
and - 47.8 kJ mol- 1 for D as were observed experimentally [9,10]. All of these parameters
are adjusted to simulate the HER in the aqueous acidic solution under the circumstance
pressure although our method and conclusion are beyond this confinement.

We find the amplitude of ¶x/¶T increases with increasing CD and/or decreasing
temperature. The dependence of ¶x/¶T on T is easy to understand by Eqs. (5), (7) and (9) in
which the amplitude of ¶x/¶T is inversely proportional to T. As far as the effect of CD is
concerned, we find the HER changes from the equilibrium state to the fast Volmer-slow Tafel
mechanism and up to the coupled Volmer-Tafel mechanism with increasing CD, and
corresponding ¶x/¶T is expressed by Eqs. (5), (7) and (9), respectively. Because the terms
DHgb + Ubx, DHgs and E0T in the numerators have the same sign (< 0), so the increase of
|¶x/¶T| with CD is obvious.

The change of x with T has two origins: one is the thermodynamic contribution as the
isobar shown in Fig. 1 or indicated by Eq. (5) and the same term appeared in Eqs. (5), (7) and
(9); another is caused by the kinetic process. A crude but intuitive explanation can understand
the reasons of x changing with T. Because x is determined by the relative CD, j/j0T [12], so
changes of j/j0T reflect the change of x in some way. For the galvanostatic charging, j0T
increases with T; this makes j/j0T decreases with T, hence x decreases some more rapidly than
in the equilibrium case.

By comparison our theory with experimental results in Ref. [6,18], we find that ¶xH/¶T ~
- 1.6 ´ 10 - 3 K - 1 and ¶xD/¶T ~ - 2.0 ´ 10 - 3 K - 1 under the galvanostatic charging condition
lie in the corresponding ranges of our results shown in Fig. 1, although the relevant
experimental parameters are not available. This indicates our theory is appropriate.


4. Discussions

In this paper, we specifically discuss the situation of HER in the acidic solution; there is a
change of HER mechanism from the fast Volmer-slow Tafel type to the coupled
Volmer-Tafel type with increasing CD. But for the basic solution, the valid CD range for the
fast Volmer-slow Tafel mechanism is very narrow even disappears; otherwise, the coupled
Volmer-Tafel mechanism dominates the HER in a wide CD range due to a small value of
j0V/j0T and a large heterogeneity energy Us [10]. Of course, our method and results can be
applied to this situation with some parameters modified. On the other hand, additives and Pd
alloy electrodes are always used to improve the electrode performance for H absorption in
experiments. Their effects can be manifested by the same formulae with some parameters
adjusted as well.

In the paper, we mainly discuss the loading ratio changing with j under the galvanostatic
charging condition. However, our theory can be applied to the problem for the maintenance
the loading ratio by increasing the amplitude of j at high temperature. The solution is directly
given by Eqs. (6) and (8).

It must be pointed out that our theory is more phenomenological than fundamental. A
general treatment should be based on the absolute rate theory and consider subtle effects of
temperature on all aspects of the Pd|H electrode process, e.g. the temperature dependence of
solute activity, the activation free energy of each step and other related issues. Of course, it
needs more experiment details as well. However, our results give the most primary effects and
there are some experiment evidences supporting our conclusions. Although the systematic
experimental study on this subject is absent up to now, we hope our work can stimulate
further researches on this issue.
