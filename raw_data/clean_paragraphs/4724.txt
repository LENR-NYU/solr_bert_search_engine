1. Introduction

In 1989, Fleischmann and Pons reported anomalous excess heat in the electrolytic system of LiOD heavy water solution
with a Pd cathode [1]. Since then, for more than 30 years, many researchers around the world have focused on this
system [2]−[5]. Recently, our lab explored excess heat in a Pd-LiOD+D2O open system, similar to that used by
Fleischmann-Pons [1] and Miles [2], with Seebeck envelope calorimetry. During open electrolysis, it was found
that the LiOD concentration decreased, while the cell voltage increased with time in the constant current mode. To
quickly determine the LiOD concentration, and to understand the electric and thermal behaviors of electrochemical
cells, the electrolyte conductivities of LiOD heavy water solutions under different concentrations and temperatures
must be obtained first. However, there was only data of 0.1 mol·L
1 LiOD solution, from 1990 [7]. In this paper, the
conductivities of LiOD heavy water solution at various concentrations and temperature are measured. At the same
time, the molar conductivities are also given. We hope these data can support future works on the Pd-LiOD+D2O
electrolytic system.


2. Experimental

The LiOD heavy water solution is made before conductivity measurements. The method is as follows. First, weigh
0.14524 g Li2O powder (Alfa, 99.5%, Order #41832; Lot #S23G011) with balance (Mettler Toledo XPR205R. max.
220 g, d = 0.01 mg) and put it into a 5 mL beaker, then add heavy water (J&K, 99.8 at.%D, Order #261750; Lot
#L240U16) and ultrasonically mix for 10 minutes to ensure that Li2O is completely dissolved. Finally, transfer the
solution from the beaker to a volumetric flask with capacity of 10 ± 0.02 mL at 20◦C and add heavy water to the
graduation line. After these procedures, we get 0.9721 mol·L−1 LiOD heavy water solution. Solutions of 0.07279, 0.1126, 0.1215, 0.2411 and 0.4867 mol·L−1 are obtained by diluting the 0.9721 mol·L −1 LiOD solution. The solution
of 0.1126 mol·L−1 is further diluted to that of 0.01409, 0.02816 and 0.05630 mol·L−1, respectively. In the end, nine
different concentrations of LiOD heavy water solutions are obtained.

Each solution is placed in a centrifuge tube, which is immersed in a water bath (PolyScience AP15R-30-A12E)
with temperature stability of ± 0.005◦C. The conductivity of the solution is directly measured by Mettler Toledo S230
conductivity meter equipped with InLab®731-ISM using a 4-ring graphite electrode. Its measurement range is 0.01
to 1,000 mS·cm−1 at temperature of 0 ∼ 100◦C (The unit of conductance is S (Siemens), which is the inverse of Ω
(Ohm), i.e., 1 S = 1 Ω−1).

The measurement is started at 10◦C and heated at a rate of 1◦C per minute, then the temperature is kept at a
constant value for 25 minutes at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70◦C, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1. The conductivity
meter is set to measure every 5 minutes and it automatically saves the data.

Before the formal measurement, the conductivity meter was calibrated with a conductivity standard solution of 111.3 mS·cm−1 at 25◦C (Shanghai Inesa Scientific Instrument Co., Ltd, Order #624101; Lot #9028N002102F00023).

Table 2. Conductivities (κ/mS·cm−1) and activation energies (Ea) of LiOD heavy water solution at different temperatures and concentrations

Then we measured another standard solution with conductivity of 12.88 mS·cm−1 ± 1.5% at 25◦C (Mettler Toledo
InLab® Solutions, Order #51350094; Lot #1F325A). The result was 13.28 ± 0.01 mS·cm−1
at 25◦C and it is consistent
with the standard value within 3.1%.

At the same time, we made a LiOH aqueous solution by mixing Li2O and H2O and measured conductivities
at two different LiOH concentrations at 25◦C as shown in Table 1. We found that our results are consistent with
the interpolated values based on data in [8] within 6.5%. This means our measurement method is reliable and the
sample preparation of LiOD heavy water solution using Li2O instead of lithium metal as in [2]−[7] is not a problem.
However, conductivities of 0.1 and 0.5 mol·L−1 LiOH aqueous solution measured by Ritley et al. [7] are 34% and 8%,
respectively, less than the accepted values in [8]. Therefore, their results of the LiOD heavy water solution are only for
reference here.


3. Results

3.1. Conductivity: The conductivities κ of LiOD heavy water solution at different temperatures T and concentrations c are listed in Table 2
and shown in Fig. 2.

Although the linearity is not obvious on the logarithmic scale, it can be observed from Fig. 2(a) that the electrical
conductivity increases linearly with increasing temperature at a constant concentration as described by:
κ = a0 + a1T

In addition, we find that a quadratic function can be used to express the relationship between conductivity and LiOD
concentration at a constant temperature as shown in Fig. 2(b) and described by:
κ = b1c + b2c2

Considering the simultaneous influences of temperature and concentration, the relationship between these three parameters can be expressed as:
κ = d1c + d2c2+d3cT + d4c2T

where d1, d2, d3 and d4 are constants. A program is used for fitting the data listed in Table 2 and we obtain the
expression:
κ = 60.56c − 14.25c2 + 2.514cT − 0.5459c2T
with T in ◦C, R2 = 0.9997 and RMSE = 0.7193. The fitting results are shown in Fig. 3, where X, Y and Z axes refer
to the LiOD concentration (mol·L−1), temperature (◦C) and conductivity (mS·cm−1), respectively.

At 25◦C, Eq. (4) can be simplified to: κ = 123.41c − 27.90c2.
The conductivity of 0.1 mol·L−1 LiOD heavy water solution at 25◦C is 12.08 mS·cm−1. It is ∼ 40% lower than the
conductivity of LiOH aqueous solution at the same alkali concentration as listed in Table 1. On the other hand, this
value is 37% higher than 8.8 mS·cm−1in [7]. Because their conductivity at 0.1 mol·L−1 LiOH aqueous solution is
34% less than the accepted value in [8], this means their results have prominent negative shifts both for LiOH+H2O
and LiOD+D2O solutions.

The LiOD concentration can be determined from conductivity based on Eq. (5) at 25◦C:
c = 8.1031×10−3κ + 1.484×10−5κ2.
This equation can be used to calculate the LiOD concentration from conductivity data in experiments. In crude
estimation, the first term is sufficient for dilute solutions.

On the other hand, the increase of electric conductivity of LiOD+D2O solution with temperature can be described
by the Arrhenius law [9], whose logarithmic form is:
lnκ = lnκ0 − Ea/RT,
where κ0 is the pre-exponential factor, Ea, the activation energy, R, the universal gas constant and T, the absolute
temperature in K. Fig. 4. shows the experimental data and the fit of Eq. (7) at 0.02816 mol·L−1. The slope of line
enables the determination of activation energy, 13.863 kJ·mol−1. As listed in the last column of Table 2, Ea = 13.2 ∼
13.6 kJ·mol−1 while c = 0.01409 ∼ 0.9721 mol·L−1, which are greater than the estimated value of 12.6 kJ·mol−1 for LiOH aqueous solution in [9].

3.2. Molar Conductivity:
Molar conductivity Λ refers to the electrical conductivity of a solution of different concentrations converted to unit
molar concentration:
Λ = κ/c

Table 3 lists the calculated molar conductivity at different temperatures and concentrations based on data in Table 2.

The limiting molar conductivity (Λ0) is defined as the molar conductivity of a solution at infinite dilution. The
molar conductivity of a strong electrolyte solution has a linear relationship with the square root of the concentration
[10] is: Λ = Λ0 − β√c. where β is constant in S·cm2·L1/2·mol−3/2. Λ0 can be obtained by extrapolation to infinite dilution as shown in Fig. 5.
The limiting molar conductivities Λ0 and slopes k obtained from these curves are listed in Table 4.

It can be seen from Fig. 5 and Table 4 that with the increase of temperature, the limiting molar conductivity and
the slope of the fitting increase at the same time.


4. Summary

We measured the conductivity of LiOD heavy water solution at temperatures of 10 ∼ 70◦C and concentrations of
0.01409 ∼ 0.9721 mol·L−1, and obtained a quadratic relationship among the conductivity, the temperature, and the
concentration. The LiOD concentration can be calculated by equations we obtained using temperature and conductivity. This provides a method for understanding the properties of the Pd-LiOD+D2O solution in electrolysis experiments.
