Nuclear Reactions and Condensed Matter Nuclear Science

The most basic nuclear reactions are fission and fusion. Fission involves the splitting of heavy nuclei into multiple lighter ones. An example of fission is the (chain) reaction utilized in atomic bombs. Fusion, on the other hand, is the reverse process of fission, where multiple light nuclei (usually two) merge to form a heavy nucleus. Hydrogen bombs utilize the fusion reaction between hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium (D-T) to form helium. Nuclear reactions release significantly higher energy than chemical reactions. For instance, during D-D thermal fusion, each deuterium nucleus, on average, releases 5.1 megaelectron volts of energy. This energy output is equivalent to the heat value of 8.5 tons of standard coal per gram of deuterium, highlighting the immense energy potential of fusion reactions. Research in this field has persisted for over half a century.

Nuclear fission requires overcoming the short-range attractive force between protons and neutrons within the nucleus. In contrast, nuclear fusion necessitates surpassing the Coulomb repulsion resulting from the positive charges of reacting nuclei. The magnitude of this repulsion is proportional to the product of the positive charges of the nuclei involved, forming a barrier known as the Coulomb potential. Even in the simplest fusion reactions, such as D-T or D-D fusion, overcoming the barrier of 0.288 megaelectron volts is necessary. This barrier corresponds to a temperature of approximately 3 billion degrees Celsius. Accounting for quantum tunneling effects and the energy distribution in a hot plasma, sustainable fusion reactions require temperatures exceeding 100 million degrees Celsius for D-T fusion (or 200 million degrees Celsius for D-D fusion).

Nuclear reactions involve energy values (> 105 electron volts) significantly higher than those in chemical reactions and physical and chemical processes at the condensed matter level (< 1 electron volt). The cross-sections of nuclear reactions are six orders of magnitude smaller than those of chemical reactions, and nuclear reaction processes are much faster. Consequently, in most cases, the chemical environment has minimal influence on nuclear processes, except for rare occurrences like the Mössbauer effect. This demonstrates the chemical independence of nuclear properties. In contrast, condensed matter nuclear science presents a different scenario. Experimental findings have revealed that specific physical and chemical conditions can greatly enhance certain nuclear reactions. This bridging of the gap between traditional nuclear physics, physical chemistry, and condensed matter physics eliminates the need for large accelerators and tokamaks in the study and utilization of nuclear energy. The significance of this development cannot be overstated.


Main Experimental Results

Anomalous Increase in Shielding Energy in Target-Beam Reactions: Since Rutherford's discovery of the planetary model of atoms through scattering experiments, target-beam reactions have become a classical method for studying nuclear physics and high-energy physics. Interestingly, in the past decade, a small international group affiliated with the Italian National Institute for Nuclear Physics (LUNA) has conducted a series of measurements on the variation of the D(d,p)T reaction cross-section in deuterium-containing materials as a function of beam energy. They discovered that the shielding energy in many metals is significantly higher than the values observed in semiconductors and insulators. Furthermore, these observations cannot be explained by existing shielding theories. The shielding energies in B-group III, B-group IV, and lanthanide metals formed as compounds after hydrogen absorption were found to be close to 25 electron volts in gas targets. In addition, using D(3He,p)4He reactions on Pt targets containing deuterium, the shielding energy was measured to be (680 ± 60) electron volts, which is the same as the shielding energy observed in D-D reactions (670 ± 50) electron volts. This indicates that shielding is an intrinsic property of metals and is independent of the incident particles. These results demonstrate that the cold fusion phenomenon is not an isolated physical phenomenon but rather the extreme case of increased shielding energy at low energy conditions, suggesting a transitional region between high-energy nuclear reactions and low-energy nuclear reactions (another way to describe condensed matter nuclear science).

Ultrasound Fusion: In addition to cold fusion, fusion has been achieved in other near-room-temperature systems in recent years, including bubble fusion and other ultrasound fusion methods. Acoustic cavitation, which increases energy density by a factor of 10^12, has led to the idea of achieving thermal fusion on a tabletop. This idea became a reality through the work of R. Taleyarkhan [5]. In 2002, he reported in Science that neutron emissions were produced by irradiating deuterated acetone (C3D6O) with ultrasound. Measurements indicated a neutron yield of (4-8) × 10^4 neutrons per second, which increased to nearly 4 × 10^5 neutrons per second two years later. The tritium-to-neutron ratio corresponded to the expected ratio for D-D fusion. Energy spectrum measurements indicated that the neutrons were products of D-D fusion. Additionally, measurements of neutrons and photons produced during 10,000 acoustic pulses showed synchronization between the two, indicating that the neutron generation occurred during the process of sonoluminescence within C3D6O bubbles. Comparative experiments with C3H6O showed no nuclear anomalies.

Following the publication of these results, several researchers used theory and experimentation to demonstrate that even considering the upper limit, the energy inside the bubbles could not reach levels of observable fusion, thus not ruling out the possibility of cold fusion. The main challenge with bubble fusion remains reproducibility, and to date, no independent replication of the experiment has been achieved. Furthermore, there have been allegations of scientific misconduct in Taleyarkhan's work, but multiple investigations have not found evidence of data fabrication, primarily identifying issues with organizational procedures.

In fact, in the field of condensed matter nuclear science research, R. Stringham from the United States had already stimulated nuclear reactions using the acoustic cavitation method. He applied ultrasound to a flowing heavy water reaction chamber with an embedded Pd or Ti film to generate superheating. B. Oliver from the U.S. Department of Energy performed mass spectrometry analysis on the gas products in a Ti-D2O reaction chamber and observed changes in the amount of 3He consistent with tritium decay, indicating the production of tritium through acoustic cavitation. In 2002, it was reported that the primary nuclear product in a Pd-D2O reaction chamber was 4He.

(1) Excess Heat in Palladium Cathode Electrolysis of Heavy Water: The results of generating excess heat through electrolysis of heavy water on palladium cathodes, known as the Fleischmann-Pons (F-P) effect, have been represented in terms of the Fleischmann-Pons cell. The F-P cell is a long, slender glass Dewar flask [1] containing a palladium cathode, a platinum wire anode coiled concentrically, a thermometer, a resistance heater, an exhaust pipe, and other components, with the mouth of the flask sealed. The electrolyte is a lithium deuteride heavy water solution, and the cell is placed in a constant-temperature water bath. The output heat power of the cell is obtained through temperature measurements, and the difference between the output and input power is commonly referred to as excess heat (though it is actually excess power). The main characteristic of typical excess heat results in the F-P effect is a positive feedback phenomenon, where the voltage decreases while the temperature increases. This indicates that it is caused by a heat source other than the electrochemical process; otherwise, only a negative feedback phenomenon would occur. Similar phenomena have been observed by several research groups, including the author's research group.

The drawback of the F-P device lies in the complexity of heat measurement, for which specialized instruments have been designed. The author also developed a calorimeter based on thermal conduction for studying excess heat [8]. Through repeated experiments, several key points for generating excess heat were discovered: first, high-temperature pre-electrolysis treatment of the sample is beneficial for subsequent occurrence of excess heat during electrolysis; second, an increase in temperature during the electrolysis process facilitates the appearance of excess heat; third, the addition of additives to the electrolyte contributes to the occurrence of excess heat. The use of these methods significantly improves the reproducibility of excess heat. Another notable feature of electrolyzing heavy water on palladium cathodes is the ability to generate high levels of excess heat, indicating that cold fusion is not only a scientific phenomenon but also has energy utilization prospects. In one round of experiments by Fleischmann-Pons, four test tubes were simultaneously electrolyzed with a constant current using palladium rods with a diameter of 4 millimeters. After two weeks, the temperature of each electrolytic cell suddenly increased to the boiling point within half an hour (see Figure 2). Even after the electrolyte was depleted, the temperature remained at 100°C for three hours, indicating that the cathode could self-heat without requiring input power. Because the polyvinylidene fluoride film holding the fixed electrodes inside the Dewar flask had melted, the temperature at the end of electrolysis should be above 300°C. A similar experiment by Tadahiko Mizuno in Japan is also illustrative. A palladium tube weighing approximately 100 grams continuously produced several watts of excess heat for a month, and eventually, the electrode became red-hot, with excess heat reaching over one hundred watts, causing the electrolytic cell to be unable to cool the electrode. Mizuno then threw the electrode into a barrel of water and continued adding water, requiring a total of 37.5 liters of water to cool it down over the course of 11 days. The latent heat of evaporation of the cooling water alone reached 85 megajoules, and combined with the previously generated excess heat, the electrode produced a total of 97 megajoules of energy, equivalent to the heat value of 2.8 liters of gasoline, enough to propel an ordinary car for 27 kilometers.

These major characteristics of significant excess heat are as follows: first, open electrolysis; second, high temperatures often near the boiling point, reaching over 300°C; third, large samples, with sizes above millimeters, and no samples below millimeter scale; fourth, the occurrence of self-sustaining heat. The power density of current nuclear power plants is 20 watts/gram or 150 watts/cubic centimeter, while the self-sustaining heat power in the aforementioned Fleischmann-Pons experiments reaches 3.7 kilowatts/cubic centimeter. Therefore, it appears that cold fusion has a high probability of being used for heating and power generation.

Excess heat typically requires external excitation to be generated. Over the years, various methods such as high voltage, magnetic fields, and heat have been used to excite excess heat, among which the use of lasers has shown better repeatability.

The discovery of this effect can be traced back to the Letts group (D. Letts) in the United States [9]. They first electrolyzed Pd foils with deuterium and then used an auxiliary gold electrode as the anode, gold-plating the palladium cathode until it turned black. After disconnecting the gold anode circuit and continuing the original electrolysis process, excess heat could be induced by irradiating the cathode with red laser light. In over a thousand experiments conducted over three years, excess heat up to 5 to 30 times greater than the power of the laser itself was observed. In one experiment, a maximum excess heat of 350 milliwatts was generated by irradiating the cathode with a 682.3-nanometer, 30-milliwatt laser. Subsequently, multiple groups reproduced this result and found that only an appropriate thickness of gold had the optimal effect, although the dependence of excess heat on wavelength was not very clear. The Letts group and the Violante group from Italy both confirmed that the polarization direction of the laser affects excess heat.

In 2009, Letts collaborated with Hagelstein (P.L. Hagelstein) and used lasers with different wavelengths to create beat frequencies. Excess heat peaks were observed around the beat frequency peaks centered at 8.3 THz, 15 THz, and 20.5 THz, with a half-peak width of 2 THz, while no excess heat was observed in other beat frequency regions [10].

(2) Nuclear Products: In the early stages of cold fusion, because the measured radiation nuclear products such as neutrons and tritium are much lower than the expected values for hot fusion, some people speculate that the main reaction pathway is: D + D → 4He + 23.85 MeV, with 4He as the primary nuclear product. M.H. Miles, Ryoji Goto, and the group of Zhang-Huangtian have successively confirmed the correlation between 4He and excess heat. Miles was the first to measure the ratio of 4He to excess heat as (0.7 ~ 2.5) × 10^11 atoms/joule, which matches the expected value, indicating the correctness of the hypothesis and the reaction occurring in the near-surface region. After many years of effort, the groups of M.C.H. McKubre and F. Violante measured the ideal value of 4He in the range of 50 ± 15% to 100 ± 10%, confirming that 4He is indeed the main nuclear product.

Another easily measurable cumulative nuclear product is tritium. Tritium production is spontaneous and random, and its quantity is about 9 orders of magnitude lower than that of 4He. Several typical results are as follows:

W.B. Clarke from the United States [11], using a Pd cylinder provided by Yoshimitsu Takada, which had been electrolyzed for about half a year and contained nearly 5 grams of palladium black, measured an atomic number of (2.3 ± 0.5) × 10^12 cm^−3 of ^3He in the gas phase, and after 54 days, an increase in ^3He was observed. The distribution of ^3He on the electrode shell decreased with increasing radial thickness, indicating that ^3He originated from tritium decay.

The Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) in India observed a large amount of tritium production in heavy water electrolysis experiments with Pd cathodes. The main characteristics are as follows: firstly, tritium and neutron production occur randomly and in bursts; secondly, an increase in tritium was observed after neutron emission, indicating that both are produced simultaneously; thirdly, the ratio of neutrons to tritium is 10^−6 to 10^−9. The research group led by Wang Dalun in China was the first to observe the production of tritium and neutrons through palladium tube electrolysis of heavy water in April 1989, which was similar to the results obtained by BARC.

The group led by J.O.M. Bockris in the United States discovered many new elements in the 1-micron thick region of palladium electrodes that had undergone long-term electrolysis in heavy water. This was the earliest report of nuclear transmutation and was subsequently confirmed by multiple groups. Tadahiko Mizuno in Japan also discovered many transmutation nuclear products in high-temperature plasma electrolysis of palladium cathodes. Although the patterns of transmutation products are not yet well understood compared to 4He production, some patterns have become clear. For example, in collaboration with J. Dash from the United States, the author has observed clear silver signals in palladium cathodes electrolyzed in heavy water at the edge, cracks, and central regions of volcano-like morphologies, with a few sample points consisting mainly of silver, or even pure silver. In addition, products such as nickel, cadmium, and gold have been detected, although they occur much less frequently.

The group led by S. Szpak at the U.S. Naval Weapons Laboratory electrolyzed palladium salt heavy water solution to co-deposit.
The research mentioned several systems that produce excess energy or nuclear radiation, including the deuterium-deuterium (D-D) system, the titanium-deuterium (Ti-D) system, and the nickel-hydrogen (Ni-H) system.

In the D-D system, researchers observed the production of helium-4 (4He) as the primary nuclear product. The correlation between 4He and excess heat was confirmed by various research groups. The ratio of 4He to excess heat was measured within the range of 50 ± 15% to 100 ± 10% of the expected values. Tritium (3H) was also detected as an easily measurable cumulative nuclear product, but in significantly lower quantities compared to 4He.

The Ti-D system had fewer studies, but some research groups reported the generation of excess heat in this system. Most of the research in this system focused on nuclear measurements, with the detection of neutrons being the primary observation. The neutron emission was found to be sporadic and occurred in a burst-like manner.

The Ni-H system was extensively studied by several research groups. Excess heat was observed in experiments involving nickel cathodes and electrolysis with heavy water (D2O). The system demonstrated stable isotopes with atomic numbers ranging from 3 to 92. The isotopes were found to concentrate in certain atomic number ranges, with peaks at approximately 12, 30, 48, and 80. The results indicated nuclear transmutations rather than impurity contamination, and the distribution of isotopes within the metal suggested that they were not introduced from the external environment. Other systems, such as yeast and virus cultures, were also studied and showed the generation of various isotopes.

It's important to note that these findings are from a specific period and may not reflect the most recent developments in the field of cold fusion research.


The theoretical explanation

Although there is abundant experimental evidence in condensed matter nuclear science, the mainstream academic community has not yet recognized it. The reasons for this are the complexity and lack of self-consistency of the experiments, as well as the low repeatability. Another important factor is the lack of theoretical understanding. Although humans have never directly observed black holes, people generally believe in their existence because theory supports it. The difficulty in understanding condensed matter nuclear science theory can be understood by looking at the century-long history since the discovery of superconductivity. In 1911, K. Onnes discovered the superconductivity of metals, but it took almost half a century for people to understand the microscopic mechanism of superconductivity after the BCS theory proposed by Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer. Even now, the specific mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity discovered in 1986 is still a subject of debate. The fundamental difficulty of condensed matter physics lies in the inclusion of a large number of complex interactions among multiple bodies. However, the fundamental characteristic of science is analytical, and the basic contradiction between the complex world and simple analysis has led to many theoretical difficulties in condensed matter physics, which is also the fundamental difficulty of condensed matter nuclear science.

Based on current understanding, the theory of condensed matter nuclear science needs to address at least three problems: (1) Coulomb barrier problem: how can nuclear reactions overcome such high Coulomb barriers at low energies? (2) Branching ratio anomaly: why do low-energy nuclear reaction pathways differ completely from traditional beam-target reactions? For example, the D-D reaction does not release tritium and neutrons but releases a large amount of helium-4. (3) Energy release problem: why is the reaction energy released in the form of heat rather than nuclear radiation? Of course, there are many other questions, such as why hydrogen-containing systems mainly undergo transmutation reactions while deuterium-containing systems mainly undergo fusion reactions. All theories must address these issues simultaneously. On the other hand, if a theory can correctly explain one of these problems, it should also be able to explain all the problems. Various theories have been proposed to address these issues and incorporate some experimental phenomena.

It can be said without exaggeration that the number of theoretical models in condensed matter nuclear science is greater than the number of researchers in the field. Some people have proposed several theories, but very few theories have gained widespread acceptance. E. Storms stated that 99% of the existing models will be eliminated, and the author believes that this is also the opinion of 99% of theoretical researchers, although everyone hopes that their theory will survive. Most models have fatal flaws. To discuss specific models is not productive, so here is a brief overview of some theories that have common characteristics or have had some influence.

The theory closest to traditional explanations is based on condensed matter physics and discusses how various shielding effects can enhance the nuclear reaction rate. For example, the LUNA group, the Milli group in the United States, the Violante group in Italy, and F. Frisone have discussed the effects of inner-shell electrons, lattice deformation and vacancies, plasmons, and d electrons on shielding. However, these theories are not sufficient to explain the experimental results. A slightly different approach is to establish the relationship between various excitations in hydrogen-containing metals and nuclear reactions. Examples include Hagelstein's phonon theory, Chubb's ion band state model, and Kim's Bose-Einstein condensation mechanism. Cluster models at various scales that include various particles are also favored by theorists. They hope to reduce the Coulomb barrier of nuclear reactions using these models. Models with a small number of particles, such as various hydrogen (deuterium) atoms and molecular models, have been proposed. Zhang Xinwei in China proposed that electrons moving at the speed of light will form new bound states with atomic nuclei with a probability greater than classical values, called "small hydrogen (deuterium) atoms." Meulenberg and Mullinberg in the United States, Zhang Zhongliang and Zhang Zhaqun in China, and Lu Runbao have proposed new hydrogen (deuterium) atomic or molecular bound states (metastable states). Models involving multi-particle clusters, such as Storms' clusters of deuterium and metals, Shoulders' electron clusters, Lewis' plasma clusters resembling spherical lightning, and Adamenko's electron-nucleus plasma clusters, have also been proposed. There are various theories on small-scale nuclear structure, such as Dufour's proposal of the Yamada attractive potential between D-D, Hora's further development of the atomic nuclear shell model, proposing the existence of higher proton, neutron, and total nucleon number magic numbers to explain the observed distribution of transformational nuclear products. There are also various theories on multi-neutron states, such as Fisher's neutron drop theory in the United States and Kojima's two-neutron state model.

Another approach is to use mechanisms that increase the tunneling probability in quantum mechanics, similar to the muon-catalyzed fusion, such as electron-catalyzed fusion, proposed by Bush and resonant tunneling models, advocated by Lee Sangjun and others. Li Jiaquan proposed a composite tunneling model, and many other theories provide explanations of cold fusion from a more fundamental physics perspective. For example, the zero-point energy model proposed by Jiang Xingliu in China. Because experiments in condensed matter nuclear reactions require non-equilibrium conditions, some people also rely on time-dependent interactions in quantum mechanics, such as Takahashi Ryohito in Japan and Chechin in Russia.

Finally, although many scholars hope to propose good theories to explain and guide experiments, the reality is that due to the complexity of the phenomena, theory lags behind experiments. Perhaps the direction of theoretical efforts can only be truly indicated when decisive experiments appear. Just like the isotope effect in superconductivity, which explained the involvement of phonons in the superconducting mechanism, this also depends on the efforts of experimental researchers.

The author believes that [15], the experimental results of condensed matter nuclear science first demonstrate that humans can achieve high-energy reactions that were previously only achievable with large accelerators through small devices under relatively easily attainable and mild conditions. This implies the miniaturization of low-energy nuclear physics experiments and may have a revolutionary impact on the study of the production and evolution of cosmic elements and the utilization of nuclear energy.

Secondly, fusion is one of the permanent solutions to the human energy problem. According to the D-D reaction in cold fusion, which generates 4He, and the energy efficiency is equivalent to consuming only ten liters of gasoline per hundred kilometers, the energy released from the deuterium-deuterium cold fusion in 30 milliliters of heavy water, which currently has a retail price of 150 RMB, is enough to power a small car to travel one million kilometers. The process of achieving cold fusion is much milder than that of hot fusion, and it has no nuclear pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, cold fusion has the potential to ideally solve the energy problem for all of humanity.

In addition, the changes at the physical and chemical levels in condensed matter nuclear science experiments can alter nuclear radioactivity. Therefore, it is now possible to achieve permanent and safe disposal of radioactive nuclear waste from nuclear power plants and nuclear disarmament through this approach. Figuratively speaking, cold fusion can not only replace hot fusion as a driving force but also clean up after nuclear fission. Therefore, the development of condensed matter nuclear science may not only bring about scientific and technological revolutions but also potentially change human lifestyles and geopolitical dynamics. Some of these impacts are foreseeable, while others go beyond current human imagination.
