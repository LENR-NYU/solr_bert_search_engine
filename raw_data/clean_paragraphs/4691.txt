I. INTRODUCTION

When an external bending is applied to a solid, the induced
deformation field will cause interstitials in the sample
to move toward expanded areas; this phenomenon is known
as the Gorsky effect.1,2 Moreover, the stress induced by the
concentration gradient of interstitials inside a solid without
any external bending has a similar effect as well.3,4 For hydrogen
diffusion across metallic membranes, Lewis and coworkers
and some other researchers showed that the internal
stress results in a flux opposing to that generated by diffusion.
This feature has been referred to as ‘‘uphill
diffusion.’’5–14 They verified that the self-stress not only
leads to a misestimation of diffusion coefficient using the
time-lag method,5–10 but also modifies the steady-state distribution
of interstitial in solids ~H in metals or alloys in their
case!.10–14 This means that one must be cautious about measuring
the diffusion coefficient of interstitial in solids either
by the transient or steady-state method. However, there still
exist some controversies on the problem of the steady-state
distribution of interstitial in solids. Li3 and Baranowski15 had
predicted that the linear profile is the natural result, but some
latter theoretical and experimental works supported the concept
of the non-linear distribution.10–14,16,17 In an earlier paper,
Zhang et al.18 have proved analytically and numerically
that the linear profile is the only solution for interstitial ~hydrogen!
diffusion across an elastic membrane in the steady
state while the metal-hydrogen system is in the phase of
dilute solution. Owing to the fact that self-stress experiments
are always carried out in the situation of high hydrogen concentration
where the interaction between hydrogen atoms
and the blocking effect in diffusion must be concerned, so
the applicability of this conclusion from the dilute solution
condition is in doubt in the practical cases. In this paper, we
will further prove that the self-induced stress supresses the
departure of the concentration distribution from the linearity,
and the diffusion coefficient deduced from the steady-state
diffusion flux, plate thickness and concentration step is valid
even while the self-stress effect is present. To be specific, we
discuss the hydrogen diffusion across a fcc metallic plate
because hydrogen in these materials, such as Pd and Pdbased
alloys, has been extensively studied in the self-stress
experiments.5–16


II. MODEL AND RESULTS

According to Refs. 3,4 and 15, the chemical potential of
hydrogen interstitial in a metallic lattice ~M! under a stress s
can be expressed as
Eq. (1) where mH(x,0) denotes the chemical potential of hydrogen in
the stress-free state (s50) and it plays the role of the standard
state with respect to the stress s; x symbolizes the
relative concentration of H in M and is expressed as the
atomic ratio of H/M. For fcc metals and alloys above mentioned,
H occupies only the octahedral interstitial site and we
have 0<x<1. VH is the partial molar volume of H in M.
Referring to Baranowski19 and Fukai,20 VH51.69 cm3/mol
while x,0.75 and VH50.18;0.42 cm3/mol while x.0.75.

The chemical potential of H under the stress-free state in
Eq. ~1! may be replaced by the expression
Eq. (2). The first term in the right-hand side of this equation is the
chemical potential of the reference state, the second one is
the enthalpy, the third term is the configurational entropy, R
is the universal gas constant, T is the absolute temperature in
K.

The enthalpy HH(x) in Eq. ~2! changes with x due to the
H-H interaction and it is generally a concave function as
shown in Fig. 1. It can be expanded in a power series to the
first order,
Eq. (3). 
The linear approximation indicates that this expression is
valid only in a certain range of x near x0. From the point of
view of physics, the change of enthalpy originates from the
elastic and electronic interactions between H atoms.20 The
elastic interaction is caused by the dilatation of the metallic
octahedral sites arising from the occupying hydrogen atoms
and it leads to attractive interactions between H atoms in the
lattice. It is found that Ub5250;220 kJ/mol for Pd and
Pd-based alloys while x0!1.20,21 When x0 increases to a
certain value (its magnitude depends on the sorts of M), the
enthalpy decreases to the minimum and it then increases with
x0 up to the saturation absorption (x051). The increase of
enthalpy with x0 results from a stepwise in the Fermi energy,
which occurs after electrons from the dissolved hydrogen fill
the d band of metal and the additional electrons enter the s
band.22 It is found that Ub550 kJ/mol for Pd when 0.6
,x0,0.86.

Similar to the model used in previous papers,4,15–18 we
consider hydrogen diffusion across a thin plate that allows
our analysis to be reduced to a one-dimensional problem (see
Fig. 2). The self-induced stress is
Eq. (4), where Y=E/(1-n), E is Young’s modulus, E5(1;2)
31011 Pa, n is Poisson’s ratio, n50.3;0.4, C0 is the saturation
concentration of H in M corresponding to x51, C0
50.1;0.15 mol H/cm3; L is the plate thickness, z is the
coordinate along the diffusion direction, the upstream side is
z50 and the downstream side is z=L.

As verified experimentally, the mechanism of hydrogen
diffusion in fcc metals is the H atom jumping between neighboring
octahedral interstitial sites, the blocking factor is (1
2x). Thus the hydrogen flux has the form
Eq. (5), where D0(12x) is the Einstein diffusion coefficient. Introducing
Eqs. (1)–(4) into Eq. (5), we obtain the hydrogen
flow in the most general form for present purposes:
Eq. (6). Applying the mass balance condition to the flux expression
gives
Eq. (7). The boundary condition is
Eq. (8), where x* is the hydrogen concentration at the outer surfaces
corresponding to the imposed hydrogen pressure for the gas
phase technique or the potential for the electrochemical technique
under the stress-free condition. Equation (8) is similar
to the first boundary value condition in some sense as shown
in Fig. 2.

For the purpose of analytical and numerical treatment,
further analysis is carried out in terms of dimensionless variables
and equations. Introduction of the following symbols
Eq. (9),
Eq. (10),
Eq. (11),
Eq. (12),
Eq. (13), and
Eq. (14), where ub , s0, and us are material constant. ub is the H-H
interaction factor; s0 is the maximum self-induced stress; us
is the self-stress factor. Using the values mentioned above,
we have ub5220–20, s051.7–56 GPa, and us50.1–40 at
room temperature. Besides the variables in Eqs. (9)–(14), we
introduce another quantity, A(t), defined as
Eq. (15). Thus Eqs. (4) and (6)–(8) can be simplified to
Eq. (16),
Eq. (17),
Eq. (18), and
Eq. (19), respectively.

We attempt to analytically solve these equations in the
steady-state diffusion. Because A and j are all time independent
in the case, Eq. (17) is reduced to an ordinary differential
equation and x is uniquely determined by j . Integrating
Eq. (17) with respect to j from j to 1 by separation of
variables leads to
Eq. (20) with
Eq. (21). x as a function of j can be iteratively solved through combining
Eqs. (15) and (19)–(21). Assume a set of values, j,
xR , and A, new values of xR and A can be iteratively extracted
by combining Eqs. (15), (20), and (21). Adjust j and
repeat the above procedure up to the resulted xL* being equal
to the known value. Numerical results shown in the table and
figures of this paper are calculated using this method. For the
sake of contrast, we do not directly show x but illustrate its
departure from the ideal linear distribution
Eq. (22) in the figures.

Another way of obtaining x is to numerically solve the
partial integro-differential Eqs. (15)–(19), the desired solution
is acquired when t is large enough (t@1). Of course,
results achieved by these two methods are consistent with
each other.

For understanding this phenomenon more clearly, we give
the series solution in the below. First of all, rigorous results
can be obtained for two special situations. One is for us
to 0, solution of Eq. (17) is
Eq. (23). The corresponding numerical results are shown by dotted
curves in Figs. 3–6. We find they are all the most bent
curves and the magnitude of nonlinear part is much less than
that of the linear one while x is large.

Another special case is for ub to 0, there is
Eq. (24). This is the linear solution as has been discussed in the earlier
studies3,15,18 although the blocking effect in diffusion and the
configuration entropy in chemical potential of hydrogen are
involved here. An example of this solution, the horizontal
dotted line, is shown in Fig. 3(a). For a more general situation,
a power series expansion for x about the point j51/2 to
the third order gives
Eq. (25) where xm is the value of x in the central plane j51/2. As a
crude approximation, xm can be replaced by the average
value of xL and xR . Substituting this equation into Eq. (15)
gives
Eq. (26) in the second-order approximation. Introducing Eqs. (25) and
(26) into Eq. (17), we obtain the expansion coefficients
Eq. (27),
Eq. (28), and
Eq. (29). From Eq. (27), we find that a1 is out of relation to us , this
means that the linear part of the concentration distribution is
independent of the self-stress. By Eqs. (28) and (29), we find
that a2 and a3 to 0 when ub to 0 or us
to infinity. The former condition makes Eq. (25) equivalent to Eq. (24) and the latter
case means that the self-stress suppresses the departure of
concentration distribution from linearity as illustrated in
Figs. 3–6. Of course, Eq. (25) is reduced to the series solution
of Eq. (23) when us to 0.

Substituting Eq. (25) into Eqs. (15) and (16), we obtain
the residual self-stress in the steady-state,
Eq. (30). Because the linear concentration profile gives the zero stress,
the residual self-stress arises from the nonlinear part of the
concentration distribution. In the second-order approximation,
only the term with a2 is left; the self-stress is symmetrical
about the central plane of plate and s50 at j=0.21 and
0.79 which explain why several stress curves in Fig. 3(b)
seem to intersect at these two points on the zero stress axis.
Figure 3(b) reveals that the second-order approximation is
appropriate while the self-stress factor us is large enough.

The stress-induced flux is
Eq. (31). As a second-order approximation, this expression and results
shown in Figs. 3–5 indicate that the stress-induced flux increases
with increasing us , and js has opposite contributions
to the overall flux in the two different half regions (0
,j,1/2 and 1/2,j,1).

Figures 3–6 show the numerical results of dx , s/s0 and
js / j as functions of j with different parameters. Examples
shown in Fig. 3 are for the dilute solution of H in M (a
phase, ub,0). The situation of hydride phase (b phase, ub
.0) is shown in Fig. 4; we find that the relative quantities of
the self-stress and stress-induced flux are much less than
those in the a phase. This is because that a2 is very small
when ub.0 as indicated by Eq. (28). From the point of view
of thermodynamics, the chemical potential increases sharply
with x while x.1/2 as discussed above and shown in Fig. 1.
Therefore the relative contribution of self-stress to the total
chemical potential decreases with increasing x, as well as the
self-stress effect.

Although Figs. 3 and 4 show two different situations, they
have the same feature, i.e., dx,0 or x is a concave function
of j . The solid samples bear the compressive stress near
surfaces and the tensile stress in the central region as before
illustrated in the hydrogen absorption process.3,16 However,
we find that the contrary situation can occur when a2,0 in
Eq. (30), which corresponds to ub.0 and xm,1/2, or ub
,0 and xm.1/2 as indicated by Eq. (28). Figure 5 shows an
example of this situation, it is found that the H concentration
distribution is slightly protrusive and x is great than the ideal
linear case (dx.0). The self-stress and stress-induced flux
are in contrast with those of Figs. 3 and 4. In experiments,
this situation can be realized by raising temperature or using
some alloys, so the miscibility gap of different phases disappears
and only one phase exists. Formally, if xm.1/2 and
ub,0, there will be the similar result but this situation is rare
because ub.0 while x is large.

Another interesting phenomenon occurs when xm51/2 as
illustrated in Fig. 6. In the case, the stress effect must be
described by the third-order approximation due to a250.
The nonlinear part of the concentration distribution and the
stress profile have third-order characteristics, and the stressinduced
flux has a quadric form as indicated by Eqs. (25),
(30), and (31), respectively. Different features between Fig. 6
and Figs. 3–5 make us obtain the condition
Eq. (32) under which the second-order approximation is valid; otherwise,
the third-order approximation must be considered. Introducing
Eqs. (28) and (29) into this equation and neglecting
the higher-order terms, we get the condition being
equivalent to Eq. (32),
Eq. (33). This criteria is based on the series expansion about the
middle point j51/2. Actually, x can be expanded at any
point in the overall range of 0<j<1, so we find that a2
50 if x51/2 at the point expanded from Eq. (28), so we
obtain the necessary condition for consideration of the thirdorder
approximation
Eq. (34). Otherwise, the second-order approximation is enough to describe
the self-stress effects.


III. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

By Figs. 3–6, we find that the self-stresses flatten the
nonlinear distribution and it presents a striking contrast to
other researchers’ prediction; this phenomenon can
be understood through the stress distribution. For the concave
profile of x vs j , the stress distribution is protruding.
Because a stress-induced flux js is proportional to the gradient
of stress, so js is positive and negative in the left and
right regions, respectively. This means that the self-stresses
make the pit of concentration departure from the linearity to
be filled in. Similarly, the same mechanism can explain that
the stresses make the pile of concentration departure from
the linearity to be cut out as shown in Figs. 5 and 6. In
previous works, it was considered theoretically and verified
experimentally10–14 that the self-stresses make the hydrogen
distribution has a concave shape or S shape along the
diffusion direction in plates. Our results demonstrate the contrary
situation, i.e., the concave, protruding and S shape profiles
of hydrogen content under the stress-free condition will
be straightened by the self-stresses. It indicates that the corresponding
experimental results associated with the "nonlinear
distribution" need further interpretation using other
mechanisms. On the other hand, our results show that the
linear profile of hydrogen concentration is a good approximation
for the steady-state diffusion in an elastic membrane.
Although these results are obtained from the system of hydrogen
in fcc metals or alloys, this mechanism and conclusion
can be extended to all sorts of interstitials in solids.

Another striking feature of our results is that the fluxes
almost maintains constant values either for self-stress is absent
or present, weak or strong as shown in Table I. The
reason is that the diffusion flux is determined by the gradient
of the chemical potential as indicated by Eq. ~5!, and it
should be constant for fixed imposed boundary conditions.
Despite the self-stress modifies the local concentration of
interstitial, the chemical potential and its gradient, which
corresponds to the interstitial flux, do not change with selfstress
in the steady state. For practical cases, this means that
the average diffusion coefficient can be measured by the relation
D5LJ/DC (DC is the concentration difference across
the diffusion membrane) and it is independent of whether the
self-induced stress is concerned or not. Of course, the boundary
condition of Eq. (8) must be satisfied; in other words, the
interface process must be fast enough to reach the pseudoequilibrium.

A basis of our model is that the sample consists of
dislocation-free crystals and all stresses created are not relaxed
at grain boundaries or by plastic flow. The validity of
this assumption in experiments depends on the sort of material,
processing of material preparation and specific condition.
Nevertheless, some conclusion can be reached from our
results as discussed above. We find that the maximum selfstress
in our model is in the order of 10 MPa which is less
than the yield stress of most materials, therefore the stress
may be maintained for a long time. Another fact is that the
magnitude of self-stress decreases with the increasing of hydrogen
concentration as shown in Figs. 3–6, this means the
self-stress effect is not prominent at the high hydrogen concentration
as discussed above.

In summary, we have established a model describing hydrogen
diffusion across an elastic fcc metallic plate. This
model includes the self-stress effect of hydrogen insertion,
H-H interaction and blocking effect in diffusion. The results
indicate that the self-stress flattens the nonlinear distribution
of hydrogen concentration in the plate and it is contrary to
the conventional viewpoint. On the other hand, the diffusion
flux maintains constant even while the self-stress effect is
present.
