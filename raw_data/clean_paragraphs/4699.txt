1. Introduction

In earlier works, we presented models describing self-stresses and related effects produced by hydrogen interstitials
in thin shells and circular-plates [1,2]. The up-hill
diffusion (UHD) and related phenomena were demonstrated and interpreted by these theories. However, these
results are qualitatively consistent with experimental data
[3–9]; quantitatively comparisons need consider the surface kinetics and other processes that have been omitted
previously. For example, the galvanostatic charging is
always treated as the first or second boundary condition in
diffusion problems [3–5,7,9]; nevertheless, experimental
and theoretical studies have verified that the steady flux is
than the charging current, and the exited flux transient
may differ from the result of concentration-step or flux step assumption [10–12]. In Fig. 5 of Ref. [9], the
pressure change corresponds to an exited hydrogen
flux of 0.07 mA cm , which is only 0.54% of the
actual charging current 13 mA cm . Therefore, it is
naturally concluded that the electrochemical process affects transport properties in self-stress experiments. In this
paper, we will discuss the whole steps of hydrogen
diffusion across tubular membranes of Pd or Pd based
alloys under electrochemical conditions using numerical
methods based on models established earlier [1,2,13–15].


2. Model

Consider a metallic tube with one end sealed and
another opened to a gauge for pressure measurement, the
tube is immersed in an electrolyte. Similarly to the
previous work [1], we use a one-dimensional model to
simulate the actual processes; the coordinate z is along the
thickness direction. There are three different processes
taking place in this system, i.e. the electrochemical reaction
at the interface of electrolyteuelectrode (z50),
hydrogen diffusion in the tube wall (0,z,L, L is the
thickness of tube wall) and hydrogen adsorption–desorption
tion at the interface of solidugas (z5L).

Because the tube surface is plated with Pd-black in
experiments [3–9], we only need concern the PduH and
PduH O interfaces, which has been studied extensively. At
the electrolyteuelectrode interface, the hydrogen electrode
reaction is along the Volmer–Tafel route for Pd [13,14,16],
the applied current density j is the same as the rate of the
Volmer step with the capacity current omitted. The adsorbed hydrogen is removed by the recombination of H
atom into H molecule (Tafel step) and the penetration of
H atom from the adsorbed state at outer surface into the
absorbed state in bulk; these processes are expressed as:
Eqs.(1), where J and J are rates of the Tafel and penetration
steps, respectively. These two reactions are related to
surface parameters by below Eqs. (13) and (14):
Eqs.(2), and
Eqs.(3), with
Eqs.(4),
Eqs.(5), and 
Eqs.(6), where r is the roughness factor of Pd surface; u and us5Us /RT are the surface coverage and nonhomogeneous
factor of Frumkin adsorption, respectively; nH is the
atomic ratio of hydrogen to metal (M) and it takes the
subsurface value in Eq. (3); n is the average value of nH
in the overall thickness; ub5Ub /RT is the non-ideal
interaction factor of H in metallic materials, ub5221.8
for the a-phase Pd–H at room temperature [17]; u is the
self-stress factor and is a dimensionless material constant,
u 516.3 for the a-phase Pd–H at room temperature;
VH51.7 cm mol is the partial molar volume of H in Pd
and Pd-based alloys [18,19]; E is Young’s modulus, E = 112 GPa for Pd; n is Poisson’s ratio, n50.38 for Pd; C is
the concentration of H in M corresponding to n 51,
C 50.113 mol H cm23 for Pd. The subscript 0 indicates
the equilibrium value of the corresponding quantity. The
other symbols have their usual meanings.

Taking account of the mass balance on the outer surface,
we obtain the time dependence of the adsorbed hydrogen
coverage: Eqs.(7), where G 52.2310 mol H cm is the saturation
coverage of H on Pd(100) surface [20].

At the subsurface, there is: Eqs.(8), the hydrogen diffusion flux J has the form [15] 
Eqs.(9),
where D is the stress-free diffusion coefficient of H in M
while n →0. Applying the mass balance condition to the
flux expression, one gives
Eqs.(10).

At the solidugas interface (z5L), there is only the Tafel
step taking place. Because the reaction is near equilibrium
and there is Pd-black plated on this surface, we assume
that the chemical potential of adsorbed hydrogen is the
same as that of gas inside the tube
Eqs.(11), where s is Sieverts constant, s52.8431023 torr21 / 2 for
the a-phase Pd–H at room temperature.

The amount of hydrogen diffused across the tube wall
and collected inside the tube can be measured by the
pressure change:
Eqs.(12), where the exited flux J 5J (L,t), p is the initial
hydrogen pressure, A is the area of the tube wall involved
in the diffusion process, V is the volume into which the
exited hydrogen is collected and the other quantities have
their usual meanings.

The initial condition is the equilibrium of hydrogen
chemical potential being approached between the liquid,
solid and gas phases, the homogenous distribution of
hydrogen content in the tube wall, and the zero current of
j, JTand JP.

The boundary condition at outer surface depends on
techniques applied; for the galvanostatic charging as used
experimentally [3–5,7,9], it is
Eqs.(13). 

In this work, we give numerical results based on Eqs. (1)–(13) and using the frame reported earlier [14].


3. Results and discussion

An example of hydrogen charging process is shown in
Fig. 1. The material bulk parameters are for the a-phase
Pd–H at room temperature since its properties have been
studied extensively, experimental parameters are taken
from Ref. [4]. Fig. 1a shows pressure changes in the tube,
the UHD effect is demonstrated as expected. When the charging
time is long enough, the inner pressure approaches an asymptotic value, which depends on j, j , us,
and u as the behavior of n [13].

Fig. 1b shows the Tafel current, the penetration and
exited fluxes, we find J and J are much less than the
charging current because the hydrogen combination step
(J ) takes place at the electrolyteusolid interface. The UHD
effect also exhibits for J as the behavior of p in the initial
period. Another important point is that J is much less
than J in most of time, this means the system is in an
unsteady state, so the steady-state assumption in determinations
of hydrogen diffusivity by the time-lag method in
experiments is doubtfully. The exited flux diminishes to
zero and the system reaches the steady state after a long
charging time (.8 h), which is much greater than the
experimental duration (,23 min) [4].

Fig. 1c shows the hydrogen content in the tube wall at
different times, it also verifies that the steady state need a
long time to be approached.

There are many factors can influence the transport of
hydrogen in this system. The first one is the exchange
current density of the Tafel step J , a large J induces a
large Tafel rate J and small value of J for the fixed j, so
the exited flux J decreases correspondingly. Another
parameter is the roughness factor r, a rough electrode
surface induces J to increase more rapidly than J as T P
shown by Eqs. (2) and (3), so J also decreases. The
equilibrium surface coverage u and the nonhomogeneous 0
factor u affect J and J as well, when u and/or u
increase, the positive part of J decreases [16] and J
increases.

Because available experimental evidences on PduH
electrode indicate the penetration reaction is in pseudoequilibrium,
we take a large value of J ; otherwise, the 0T
exited flux may be very small and the UHD may be
difficult to be observed.

The interface parameters affect not only the exited flux,
but also the amplitude and time interval of UHD and the
apparent diffusion coefficient of H in M. However, we do
not discuss them in detail due to the space limited.

Fig. 2 compares the theoretical results with experimental
data in Ref. [4]; they are consistent with each other. Of
course, the surface parameters utilized in this work are
empirical because there are no related data on this system.

In summary, the electrochemical reaction affects the
self-stress and other transport properties strongly, the
determination of the diffusivity and verifications of UHD
must consider these factors in experiments.
