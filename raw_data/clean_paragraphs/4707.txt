1. Introduction

What are key factors for
reproducibility of excess heat?
(1) Temperature increment ΔT
(2) Pre-electrolysis

First run should be the activation
process.
This process is intended utilized in
excess heat reproducibility.

3. Calorimetric Results

3.1. Calibration and contrast
experiments:
3.1.1. Calibration using resistance heater;
3.1.2. Pt|D2O electrolysis;
3.1.3. dead Pd|D2O electrolysis;
3.1.4. Pd|H2O electrolysis

3.2. Excess heat from Pd plate:
3.2.1. Excess powers on pretreatments;
3.2.2. Excess powers for different samples;
3.2.3. Excess powers and cell’s resistance:
(1) R vs. T (no excess heat)
(2) R vs. T (excess heat)
R = cell’s resistance,
T = cell’s temperature.


4. Conclusions

(1) Clear evidence of excess heat in Pd|D2O +
D2SO4 electrolytic system.
(2) Pre-electrolysis in open cells is an easy way
to reproduce excess heat in subsequent
electrolysis in closed cells.
(3) Cell’s resistances change irreversible with
cell’s temperature when excess heats appear.
