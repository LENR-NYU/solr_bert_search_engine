1. INTRODUCTION

The nuclear reactions, that any nucleon is added by radioactive capture or radioactivity, are of central
importance to understand the nuclear structure. Any one, who is interested in investigating the structure of
nucleons and their properties, should be excited to the progress on experimental results about the emission of
charged particles, such as clusters (specially heavy clusters14C, O, F, Ne, Mg and Si), fission isomers, etc. after
the first case of radioactive proton emission was observed in 1970. The discovery of 14C radioactivity gave
particularly rise to great excitement in nuclear physics. After 14C radioactivity discovered neon radioactivity
was discovered in 1985, magnesium in 1987. Evidence for silicon was obtained in 1989. Fluorine and oxygen were discovered in 1992 and 1993, respectively. Furthermore, there are another experimental results
from Miley et al [8], which should give rise to great excitement in nuclear physics also. That is the observation
results of transmutation products in electrode during the electrolysis of water. These results may be explained by
assuming that the nucleus or the cluster is a system of independent particles, moving in a mean filed created by
all nucleons, or by the theory, which could allow us to treat two-body breakup in fission. Here, it may be valuable
to do it on traditional path, as a general two-body system treatment. In this case, it may be obtained the possible
solutions of the negative energy bound states of the stable Schrödinger equation with Coulomb potential barrier
and square well potential induced by nuclear force for the system of two nuclei.


2. MODELAND RESULTS

Consider a general spherical square well combined with the Coulomb potential for a two nucleus- nucleus
system.
A regular solutions of the radial equation is.
We will discuss its solutions by three regions.
This equation is equivalent to.
for E < 0 with 2 α = 8µ | E | /  > 0, (Z Z / ) / | 2 | 2 β = 1 2 e  µ E > 0 and ρ = αr.
1. For ρ → ∞, the radial function behaves as exp(ρ/2) or exp(−ρ/2). Of course, it should be the latter one for
a suitable result.
2. On the other hand, it behaves as ρ l +1 and ρ−l for ρ → ∞. For ρ l +1 we have.
No any solution exists in this case. For ρ
-l we have.
For nr = l − n, the wave function of the corresponding bound state is the (un-normalized) wave function
constructed with the radial solution.

The possible energy levels of the stable Schrödinger equation with Coulomb barrier and square well potential
induced from nuclear force for two nuclei system could be obtained: |E1| = 25 keV for D-D; |E1| = 16.7 keV for
p-D; |E1| = 30 keV for D-T and |E1| = 12.5 keV for p-p system. Of course, the light-heavy nuclei systems also
have the similar results.


3. CONCLUSION

Based on the model of two nuclei system, our results indicate a kind of loose bound state may exist and it
has energy level in the range of a few 10 keV, which may be origins of X-ray observed in experiments.
