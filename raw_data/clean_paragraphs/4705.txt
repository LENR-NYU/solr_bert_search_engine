1. Introduction

A Seebeck Envelope Calorimeter (SEC) is a powerful tool for measuring excess heat in low
energy nuclear reaction experiments [13]. In previous works we used an SEC made by
Thermonetics Corporation [1,2]. However, this device had some intrinsic defects in our
experience: (1) The device constant was unstable. We found that it shifted by 20% in three
months; the SEC had to be calibrated before and after every experiment. (2) The heat insulation
around the calorimeter was insufficient; thus the baseline and output signal shifted daily with the
ambient temperature. This SEC had to be put into another, larger insulated box to prevent
temperature fluctuations [1,2].

In this paper, we will describe a new SEC; its merits are simplicity, stability, and accuracy.
Preliminary results on reproducibility of excess heat in the Pd-D2O system are also reported.


2. Construction of calorimeter

A schematic of the calorimeter and accessories is similar to that which was published
previously [1]. The calorimeter core consists of two aluminum alloy boxes. The inner box is the
measuring vessel with interior dimensions of 26 × 26 × 26 cm3 (17.576 L). The thicknesses of
inner and outer box walls are 4 mm and 6 mm, respectively. Thermoelectric modules (TM, 5.4 ×
40 × 40 mm3), each with 127 thermocouples, are mounted between the inner and outer walls with
screws. Thermal conductive silicone is wiped on both sides of each TM to improve thermal
conductivity. 25 TMs are distributed uniformly on each wall, except for the two facing sidewalls
which have 24 TMs because there is one hole in the center of each wall. Altogether, 148 TMs
with a total of 18,796 thermocouples are used in this calorimeter. All of the TMs are connected
in series. The heat flow during experiments is proportional to the measured emf (electromotive
force) of the TMs. The two holes ( = 2cm) in the two sidewalls mentioned above permit multifunctionality
of this calorimeter; i.e., measurements of temperature, internal resistance and
voltage of the unit-under-test (UUT). The thermal emf of the calorimeter and other signals of
UUT are measured with a Keithley 2000 multimeter which is connected to a PC through a GPIB
card, to automatically register the data.

The outer aluminum box is wired with copper tubing (in = 8 mm, out = 10 mm). Thermal
conductive adhesive is used to mount the copper tubing and the aluminum walls. The outlet of
the copper tubing is connected with the hose of a refrigerating/heating circulator (PolyScience
9112). The temperature range of this circulator is 20 to 200°C; the temperature stability is
± 0.01°C; and the pump outlet flow rate of the working fluid is 15 to 22 liters per minute. The
inlet of the copper tube around the outer box is connected with a small cylindrical heat sink (in
20 mm  hin 50 mm); a remote, circular temperature probe is placed in it. This arrangement of
the temperature probe ensures that the fluctuation of ambient temperature does not affect the
calorimeter. The inlet of the small heat sink is connected to the circular probe with another hose.
The hoses are wrapped with a polystyrene foam tubing to prevent heat losses. The calorimeter
core is placed in a larger box with inner dimension of 70 × 70 × 70 cm3. Heat insulation
materials fill the gap between these two boxes.


3. Calibration of the calorimeter

Calibration is conducted with a 6 ohm electrical heater. The four-wire Kelvin bridge method
was used to eliminate lead resistance in the measurements. Applied current was measured with a
0.1  ( 0.01%) standard resistor as shunt. A Sanyo Denki brushless fan (12 V  0.21 A, 2.5 W)
was used to make the temperature in the vessel homogeneous. The power of the fan was also
measured in a similar manner. The calibration results are shown in Fig. 1. These results are
simulated by a quadratic equation:
P /W  0.0743 0.0038  (5.899  0.0053)E /V  (0.0017  0.0014)( E /V )2
with 2 = 1.2  104, R2 = 1. P is the input power, and E is the output emf of the SEC. The device
constant is about 6, or about 30 times more sensitive than the Thermonetics SEC. The device
constant changed only 1.7% over a 9 month period. The time constant of this SEC is 5 minutes.


4. Excess heat of Pd-D2O system

A schematic of the electrolytic cell is shown in Fig. 2(a). The cell is a cylinder of borosilicate
glass (capacity is about 250 ml, in = 42 mm and out = 45 mm, wall thickness = 1.5 mm, h = 180
mm). A PTFE male cap is tapered from  47 × 5 mm2 at the top, and  41 × 15 mm2 at the
bottom. A groove of 4 mm width and 2.5 mm depth is made for O-ring in the middle of bottom
part. The O-ring (in = 31.5 mm, width = 3.55 mm) made of nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR,
resistant to acid) is used to seal the top cap against the top inner wall of glass cylinder. The top
cap has two holes, 7 mm diameter each, for the electrode lead wires. A PTFE plate ( 41 mm × 8
mm) is used to suspend the recombination catalyst above the electrode. It has 24 holes of  2 mm
for fluid (D2, O2, D2O and its vapor) passing, and also has two holes, 7 mm diameter each, for
the electrode lead wires. A PTFE rod ( 6  90 mm2) is fastened to the perforated plate and the
top cap ensures that the perforated plate is at a fixed distance above the electrolyte.

The Pd cathode was prepared from Alfa Aesar Stock # 11514, Lot # G15Q17, 99.9% purity
palladium foil (metals basis). It was cold rolled from 15  25  0.5 mm3 to 25  25  0.3 mm3.
Its surface area is 12.5 cm2 and weight is 2.1891 g. The same Pd cathode was used for all
experiments, with both isoperibolic calorimetry (IPC) and SEC.

Three platinum electrodes (two anodes and one cathode) are foils 22 × 28 × 0.02 mm3, 11.5
cm2 surface area. Four electrode lead wires are made of Pt ( 1 mm × 40  60 mm). The Pt foils
(99.95% Pt) are from General Research Institute for Nonferrous Metals. These Pt leads are
connected with copper tubes and encapsulated with glass tubes (in = 2 mm, out = 7 mm, length
= 170 mm) as shown in Fig. 2(a). The gaps between the glass tubes and the PTFE cap are filled
with glass cement.

The electrolyte contains heavy water (Beijing Chemical Reagent Company, > 99.9% isotopic
purity) mixed with H2SO4 in the mass ratio of 110:27.5 (20:3 of volume ratio or 20% of mass
concentration). The catalyst contains 0.5% Pt on 1/8 inch diameter alumina pellets (Alfa Aesar).
Three grams (62 to 64 pellets) are used in each cell.

4.1. Excess heat measured by isoperibolic calorimetry (IPC): Before samples were tested with the SEC, excess heat production from the samples was first
verified with an isoperibolic calorimeter (IPC) shown in Fig. 2(b). Two cells were connected in
series: the E cell (experimental cell, heavy water electrolyte and Pd cathode) and C cell (control
cell, light water electrolyte and Pt electrodes) [2,4]. The mass concentration of H2SO4 in light
water electrolyte is 13%. The distance between two electrodes in the C cell is adjusted to make
its voltage close to that of the E cell. These two cells are embedded in a 5 cm thick polystyrene
block in a plexiglass box (14  18  23 cm3, 4 mm wall thickness) as shown in Fig. 2(b). One Ktype
thermocouple was attached on the bottom of each cell to measure the temperature. The
output power of the E-cell was calculated using the temperature difference between it and
ambient, and the device constant deduced from the C-cell, as described in Refs. [2,4]. One
example of excess heat is illustrated in Fig. 3(a) and all results are summarized in Table I. The
excess power is 0.22 to 0.79 W in 7 runs. These results indicate this sample can produce excess
heat during electrolysis at 0.24 A cm2.

4.2. Excess heat measured by SEC: After excess heat was verified with the IPC method, the entire isoperibolic calorimeter with
the two cells installed in it (shown in Fig. 2(b)) was placed inside the SEC, where calorimetry
was again performed. One example of excess heat is shown in Fig. 3(b). We performed 11
experimental runs. Six of these produced excess heat, ranging from 0.15 to 0.41 W, as shown in
Table II. Run #3 had only the E (experimental) cell and not the C (control) cell; it also showed
the excess heat. The total excess heat was 54 kJ and average excess power was 0.22 W in these 6
positive runs. Excess power measured by IPC and SEC were qualitatively consistent as shown in
Table II.


5. Conclusion

A Seebeck Envelope Calorimeter was designed and constructed. It is sensitive; it has a fast
response, and a stable device constant. Excess heat in Dash-type cells was verified with this
calorimeter. Further work on this subject is in progress in our lab.
