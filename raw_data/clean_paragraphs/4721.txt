1. INTRODUCTION

Until now, it has not observed definitively a phenomenon of electron captured by a deuteron to be dineutron
in experiments. However, The two–neutron (“n–n coincidence measurements”) radioactivity was first observed
from beta–delayed particle emission measuring by Azuma et al. in 1979. We guess there may be a possibility of
electron captured by deuteron according to our results. It was often found a voltage drop accompanying
always “anomalous heat” to come out during our experimental of the electrolysis of D2O before. May these
voltage drops show such phenomena of electron capture? We did some investigation in this field. On the other
hand, Yang also reported similar results before.


2. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HALF–LIFE (OR MASS DEFECT) AND ATOMIC NUMBER (Z)

For results about deuteron capturing electron, investigation and some related calculating with the
experimental data presented in “NUCLEAR WALLET CARDS” will be done in this work. It can be found
easily that the electron capture process is always generated with the most of those nuclides, which are on proton
rich side, shown in the “CARDS”. Moreover, The half-lives of those nuclides increase with the number of
neutron in an isotope.

We table values on the electron capture of nuclides using below relations in Tables I to IX.


3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

As shown above, it is very clear that the electron capture processes generated with the most of those
nuclides are on proton rich side, and the half-lives of those nuclides increase with the number of neutron for
an isotope and the process generates more easily with odd number than even number of neutron.
Furthermore, a proton in a nucleon can easily capture an electron, but for a free proton, it is very difficult to
take such process. According to the parameters shown above, the final results were obtained as below:
1. The calculated half–life of electron capture of deuteron from Table IX can be expressed as:
a = A + B × N with A = 55.049, B = –2.789 and R = –0.963,
b = A’ + B’ × N with A’ = –10.542 B’ = 0.912 and R = 0.980,
When N = 1 and then aN=1 = 52.260, bN=1 = –9.630.
2. The calculated mass defect during the capturing electron by deuteron from Table XII:
When N = 1, A = 2 for deuteron and then A1,N=1= 6.682656532 × 10–5, B1,N=1= 3.78564402 × 10–11, C1,N=1= 4.011662515, so:M = A1 N=1+ B1N=1 × exp(C1N=1× A) = 6.694207691 × 10–5u.

Therefore, if A = 2, Z = 1, it implies that there is the electron captured by deuteron and the mass defect M is 6.694207691 × 10–5u. It means that the 21H1 mass is 2.014102072 u, and the
20 X2 mass is 2.01403513 u. It seems that the dineutron, or the “neutro-deuteron” 20 X2 mass is 2.01112411 u if its value is not quite right according to our treatments reported. The results above should be verified further with
more measurements on it.

The half–life of such electron capture decay is about 1.04 × 1011y, which is almost as the same as t1/2 =1.28× 109 year of K 40, the t1/2 =1.3 × 10
13 year of Te 123 and t1/2 =1.4 × 10 17 year of V 50 shown in that “CARDS”. The
mass defect of this process is 6.694207691 × 10−5u. The mass of dineutron, or “neutro-deuteron” 20 X2 here is 2.01403513 u.
