1. Introduction

Migration of hydrogen interstitials in metals or alloys has been mainly focused on the behavior under effects of elastic lattice strain resulting from lattice deformation, which can be produced either by external mechanical forces [1–3] or by internal stresses due to lattice-dilating interstitials [4,5]. As far as the internal stress is concerned, Lewis and co-workers, and some other researchers have shown experimentally that it results in a hydrogen flux opposing that generated by the overall gradient of concentration, this feature has been referred to as 'up-hill diffusion' (UHD) [6–19]. It is verified that self-stress leads to a misestimation of diffusion coefficient using the time- lag method [6–16]. Afterwards, some theoretical efforts have been made to explain the UHD and steady-state distribution of hydrogen in solids [19–29]. On the whole, it appears that the theoretical interpretations are perfect except some controversies on the problem of the steady- state distribution of interstitial in solids [19–22,25–28]. However, we have found that previous theories about UHD [19-28] contain fatal mistakes. The widely used expres- sion of self-stress produced in metallic membranes is for plates with free edges and is only valid in some limited situations such as those in Ref. [30]. But this theory has been improperly extended to thin cylindrical shells 
[19–28], which makes the calculated self-stresses and induced
effects differ prominently from the actual ones, and causes some controversies on the understanding of experimental phenomena. At the same time, there were serious errors in numerical calculations in some works because the predicted phenomena (e.g. UHD; the non-linear distribution of hydrogen concentration) cannot take place by their model [23–25]. In this report, we will propose a theory to discuss the self-stress and the induced effects for hydrogen diffusion across tubular membranes, and interpret the experimental results in a simplified and unified manner.


2. Model

According to Refs. [4,5,19,20,31,32], the chemical potential of hydrogen interstitials in a metallic lattice (M) under a stress σ for infinite dilute solid-solution can be expressed as:
Eq. (1) where denotes the chemical potential of hydrogen under the reference state; nã is the atomic ratio of H/M; V is the partial molar volume of H in M. Referring to Baranowski [33] and Fukai [34], V1 = 1.7 cm3 mol ̄ ̄1 while nå <0.75.

Considering hydrogen diffusion across a thin tubular membrane, the induced stress should be treated by the
theory of thermoelastic stresses in shells with the thermal expansion coefficient being replaced by the corresponding expansion coefficient caused by hydrogen insertion [35]. For simplicity, we deal with it by using the theory of thermal stresses in long and hollow cylinders [36] with thin walls, thus it can be treated as a linear and one-dimensional problem. The self-stress for homogeneous materials (e.g. Pd and Pd-based alloys as used experimentally [6–19]) is:
Eq. (2) with the average H atomic ratio:
Eq. (3)
where E is Young's modulus, E = (1 ~ 2) × 1011 Pa; v is Poisson's ratio, v = 0.3~0.4; C。 is the concentration of H in M corresponding to n1 = 1, С。=0.1~0.15 mol H cm3; L is the membrane thickness; z is the coordinate along the thickness direction, the upstream side is z =0 (outer surface) and the downstream side is z = L (inner surface). σ is composed of two principal stresses and they are along the axial and tangential directions of the cylinder, respectively. By comparison with the expression for plates with free edges [19–28], the resultant moment term in σ vanishes in Eq. (2) because the zero moment condition does not exist in cylinder shells. The hydrogen flux has the form [4,5]:
Eq. (4) with 
Eq. (5)
where D is the Fick's diffusion coefficient of H in M when nн→0; u is the self-stress factor and it is a dimensionless material constant, u = 13~33 at room temperature utilizing the parameters aforementioned. Eq. (4) is similar to the flux expression under self-stress in solid cylinders, spheres or plates with symmetrical boundary conditions (or infinite thickness) [4,5]. The flux is dependent on the local concentration n, the non-local non-Fickian component that appeared in previous theories [19–28] vanishes in this case. Applying the mass balance condition to the flux expression, gives one:
Eq. (6). The boundary conditions depend on the experimental technique applied. In this report, we concentrate on the electrolyte/membrane/gas situation [6–10], i.e. the outer surface of the tube is in contact with an aqueous solution
pre-saturated with H and a galvanostatic charging current
density J is applied. The boundary condition is:
Eq. (7).
The H2 gas is introduced into the tube and the inner wall
surface is active to satisfy the boundary condition
[19,27,28]:
Eq. (8) where n is the H/M ratio at the inner surface in correspondence to the imposed hydrogen pressure p under the stress-free condition, μÃ ̧ is the chemical potential of H2 gas. The pressure change in the tube is:
Eq. (9) where po is the initial hydrogen pressure, A is the area of the tube wall involved in the diffusion process, V is the volume into which the diffused hydrogen is collected and the other parameters have their usual meanings. The factor 2 in the denominator accounts for the presence of two hydrogen atoms per hydrogen molecule.


3. Results

In this section, we first discuss the UHD phenomena, the inner pressure changes and the characteristic parameters of UHD in the initial periods of hydrogen absorption. Then other problems occurred in the steady diffusion and after the interruption of steady diffusion are studied.

3.1. Up-hill diffusion:
Fig. 1 shows an example of numerical results based on Eqs. (1)–(9) with parameters shown in the caption; the numerical details are similar to those in Ref. [30]. It is found that the hydrogen pressure decreases in the initial period as observed experimentally [6–20], but the UHD is not caused by the non-local non-Fickian component in expression of J as proposed earlier [19,20,23–25]. It arises from the decrease of μ(z, t) with z≤L due to the dilation of lattice. This situation is also indicated by the accompanied distributions of hydrogen concentration and stress in Fig. 1(b) and (c). According to earlier theories [19–28], the bending of plate make the lattices near the inner surface bear the compressive stress and the chemical potential increases, so the inner pressure should increase initially as also anticipated by Baranowski [37]. On the other hand, the H/M ratio increases at the downstream as shown in Fig. 1(b) but does not decrease initially as predicted by previous theories [21,23,24,27] or changes as deduced from experimental results [9,12,13,17,18].

J 50 at t,0.

Baranowski [19] has observed that the inner pressure decreases by 1372 in the initial period of hydrogen charging and he gave a theoretical explanation based on the improper stress expression and boundary conditions. In the following, we will derive a similar relation based on our model.

In the initial time intervals, before the Fickian diffusion
Eq. (10), where n is the initial constant value of n . In the first order approximation, n 5n at z5L, inserting Eq. H H,0
(10) into Eq. (2) gives the stress on the downstream side: 
Eq. (11). Introducing Eq. (1) into Eq. (8) gives:
Eq. (12). Substituting s by Eq. (11), we have:
Eq. (13). The right hand side of this equation is a linear function of
time, the corresponding flux is [38]:
Eq. (14). Utilizing Eq. (9), we get:
Eq. (15) where 
Eq. (16).
Here a is a dimensionless constant, I = AJ is the applied current; No is the molar number of H2 in the tube. By comparison of the present predictions with the data from Ref. [19], we find they are consistent qualitatively with each other.

A similar method can be used to discuss the situations of a gas/membrane/gas experiment [11-16], where the boundary condition of Eq. (7) should be replaced by Eq. (8), and the pressure change in the tube should be proportional to t1/2 [38].

Another characteristic parameter of UHD is the maxi- mum reduction of initial pressure, - Apmax, at time tmax as shown by the pressure minimum in Fig. 1(a). It is easily understood that -APmax and tm are proportional to u Here, we discuss these parameters changing with nн, 0· At the time tax, the stress-induced flux J cancels out the concentration flux Jc, where Jc under the galvanostatic charging condition is [39]:
Eq. (17) with t 5Dt /L2 while t ,0.32, where t is the reduced diffusion time. Combining Eqs. (14) and (17) gives an equation used to solve t :
Eq. (18).
Numerical results of Tax and APmax based on Eqs. (1)-(9) are shown in Fig. 2. We find the time Tmax increases monotonically with Иí, as verified experimentally [6–8,12,13]. At the same time, it is found from Eq. (18) that Tmax is independent of the applied current, of course, this conclusion is only effective when J。 is so small that D(1 +υ ̧1Ã) almost does not change with z. The corresponding - APmax also increases with nн, as shown in Fig. 2 and observed experimentally [6–8,12,13].

3.2. Steady diffusion and interruption of steady diffusion:
An interesting and arising controversial problem is the profiles of hydrogen concentration and self-stress in the steady-state diffusion [4,19–22,25–28]. From Fig. 1(b) and Eq. (4), we find that the steady concentration distribution protrudes somewhat. This is due to the fact that the apparent diffusion coefficient D(1 +μ ̧1Ã) decreases with z, and the concentration profile is not a linear function as in the case of a free plate [4,19,20,27,28]. Because of the presence of self-stress as shown in Fig. 1(c), nн in the upstream (downstream) half region is less (greater) than that in the stress free situation. Finally, the residual stress does not vanish; this is quite different from the situation of free-edge plates [4,19,20,27,28].

Another striking feature of self-stress effects is the acceleration of permeation flux on the interruption of the charging current [17,18]. This situation is demonstrated in Fig. 3, where we find that the permeation flux and hence the change of inner pressure following the charging current being stopped are greater than those in the steady-state, and this trend of pressure change is the same as that in experiments [17,18]. Some researchers proposed that the non-linear profile of hydrogen concentration is the reason
for this behavior [17,18]. In fact, the acceleration effect is also induced by the similar reason of UHD although these two phenomena appear contrary to each other, i.e. the contraction of lattices near surfaces induced by the hydrogen desorption makes the desorption rate accelerate. This is also the reason of UHD that appears in the hydrogen desorption process.

hydrogen permeation flux while the charging current is stopped at t=0.
The dashed curve is for the stress-free situation. Other parameters are the
same as those in Fig. 1.


4. Discussion

In this work, we use a model for cylinder shells with infinite length, which differs from the finite length model by the boundary effect. In the thin-shell theory [40], the boundary effect is confined to the axial length of π√гL (ro is the radius of tube). For the parameters used in experiments [6–19], r。 = 4 mm and L = 0.2~0.4 mm, so πVr。L = 2.81~3.97 mm, which is much less than the tube length 40~80 mm. Therefore, the boundary effect can be neglected in a first order approximation. Another related problem is the deformation of membrane in the hydrogen absorption process. The tube dilates in the radial and axial directions uniformly except near the tube ends in the axial length of √г. This geometric picture differs from that of the bending of a plate with free-edges.

Different from our model, Mällo and Krozer [29] have demonstrated the UHD behavior by considering the tube as a sphere shell but not the cylinder shell. On the ground that their work has more numerical details than analytical treatments, our conclusions are more straightforward, abundant and convincing than theirs.

In this report, we have dealt only with the electrolyte/ membrane/gas situation. For the gas/membrane/gas situation, the main effects are the same as here except for the occurrence of some additional influences [11-16]. On the other hand, we have dealt only with the stress effect in the hydrogen absorption process, the effect in the hydrogen desorption process can be obtained in a similar manner. Finally, this report only provides a simple description of self-stress induced phenomena. Details of these applications and comparison with experimental results based on the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters in metal (alloy)-hydrogen systems will be given in a forthcoming more extended work.
