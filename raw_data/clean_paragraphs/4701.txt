1. Introduction

Since the discovery of the up-hill di'usion (UHD) e'ect
in hydrogen permeable metals by Lewis et al. [1], there
has been much theoretical work concentrated on the aspects
of stresses induced by the hydrogen (interstitials) di'usion
in metals (solids) [2–8]. However, the appropriate physical
pictures of self-stress e'ects in practical shapes of material
have only been given recently [9–12].

In earlier works, we presented models describing
self-stresses and related e'ects produced by hydrogen interstitials
in thin shells and circular plates [9–11]. The
UHD phenomena, the time courses of pressure change in a
tube during hydrogen absorption and interruption of steady
di'usion [1,2,13–24] were demonstrated and interpreted
by these theories. Besides these phenomena, it has been
found that self-stresses lead to changes of apparent di'usion
coe6cient (ADC) if traditional relations are applied in experiments
[1,2,13–26]. This is one of the reasons that ADCs
of H in metal (alloy) hydrides di'er from one work to another.
Because self-stresses are produced by the nonhomogeneous
concentration distribution of hydrogen in metals and
this is a necessary condition for di'usivity measurement, so
self-stresses must a'ect di'usion processes, hence the di'usivity
measurements. Therefore, it is important to diminish
or subtract this e'ect in experiments. On the other hand, effects
of self-stress on the transport of hydrogen in metals
(alloys) are an important problem in corrosion kinetics, hydrogen
storage and other related problems. All these issues
form the academic and technological backgrounds of the
present subject; we will discuss it using numerical methods
based on the model established earlier [9–11].


2. Model

Similar to the previous paper [9], the chemical potential
of hydrogen interstitials in a metallic lattice (M) under a
stress   for a dilute solid solution can be expressed as
Eq. (1) where  0H
denotes the chemical potential of hydrogen under
the reference state; nH is the atomic ratio of hydrogen
to metal; and VH is the partial molar volume of H in M.
Referring to Baranowski et al. [27] and Fukai [28], VH =
1:7 cm3 mol−1 for fcc metals and alloys while nH¡0:75.

Considering hydrogen di'usion across a thin tubular
membrane, the induced stress for homogeneous materials
is [9] Eq. (2) with the average H atomic ratio Eq. (3) 
where E is the Young’s modulus, E=100–200 GPa;   is the
Poisson’s ratio,  =0:3–0.4; C0 is the concentration of H in
M corresponding to nH =1, C0 =0:1–0:15 mol H cm−3 for
materials used experimentally [1,2,13–26]; L is the membrane
thickness; z is the coordinate along the thickness direction,
the upstream side is z = 0 (outer surface) and the
downstream side is z=L (inner surface). The hydrogen 9ux
has the form Eq. (4) with Eq. (5)
where D0 is the stress-free di'usion coe6cient (SFDC) of
H in M; u  is the self-stress factor and is a dimensionless
material constant, u  =13–33 at room temperature utilizing
the aforementioned parameters. Applying the mass balance
condition to the 9ux expression, one gives
Eq. (6).

In this report, we discuss mainly the absorption process.
The initial condition is the homogeneous distribution of hydrogen
with concentration nH;0 in the tube wall and the equilibrium
of hydrogen chemical potential approaches between
the solid and gas phases in the tube:
Eq. (7)
where  H2;0 is the initial value of the chemical potential of
H2 gas.

The boundary conditions depend on the experimental
technique applied. For the gas/membrane/gas situation, i.e.
only the gas and solid phases are involved [17–22], the
boundary condition at the outer surface is [2]:
Eq. (8)
where n∗
H is the H/M ratio under the stress-free condition,
 H2 is the chemical potential of the external H2 gas. We name
this situation as the chemopotential-step 1 and it is equivalent
to the Prst boundary condition (concentration-step) in
the stress-free case. It corresponds to pressure step and potentiostatic
charging for the gas phase and electrochemical
hydrogen absorption, respectively.

In the discussions below, we suppose that the inner volume
of the tube is large enough that the chemical potential
of hydrogen at the downstream side almost does not change:
Eq. (9)

Of course, this isobaric assumption di'ers from the isometric
condition in experiments. However, we must conPne
our discussion to this ideal situation; otherwise, the di'used
9ux, boundary condition and other kinetic parameters will
depend on the tube volume if it is small.

In the electrolyte/membrane/gas situation, i.e. the outer
surface of the tube is in contact with an aqueous solution,
there are two extreme boundary conditions depending on the
manner of hydrogen charging in experiments. For the potentiostatic
charging, the chemopotential-step condition of Eq.
(8) is appropriate with  H2 =2 being replaced by the chemical
potential of hydrogen adsorbed on the outer surface. For the
galvanostatic charging as used experimentally [1,2,13–16],
the corresponding boundary condition is
Eq. (10)
where J0 is the applied charging current density. The boundary
condition at z = L is the same as Eq. (9) for all these
situations.

The amount of hydrogen di'used across the tube wall and
collected at the downstream side can be measured by the
pressure change in the tube:
Eq. (11)
where Jex = J (L; t) is the di'used 9ux at the exit side, p0
is the initial hydrogen pressure, A is the area of tube wall
involved in the di'usion process, V is the volume into which
the di'used hydrogen is collected and the other parameters
have their usual meanings.

For the purpose of analytical and numerical treatments,
further analysis is carried out in terms of dimensionless variables
and equations. Introducing of the following symbols:
Eq. (12),
Eq. (13) and
Eq. (14).
Eqs. (4) and (6) simplify to
Eq. (15) and
Eq. (16), respectively. Using Eqs. (1) and (2), Eq. (8) is expressed as
Eq. (17). Eq. (10) is transferred to
Eq. (18) where j0 = LJ0=D0C0. The quantity of di'used hydrogen
across the tube wall is expressed by
Eq. (19) with jex = j(1;  ). Thus, Eq. (11) simpliPes to
Eq. (20).

Generally, there are four principal time characteristics to
determine the di'usion coe6cient under stress-free conditions
in experiments as shown in Table 1 [29–32]. The well
known is the time-lag  L which is dePned as the intercept
of Q on the  -axis while the di'usion time is long enough
and the permeation 9ux approaches the steady value j∞.
Another is the half-rise time  1=2 at which the permeation
9ux reaches half the value of the steady state. The other two
characteristic values, the in9ection-point and break-through
times, depend on the in9ection of current (d2jex=d 2 = 0)
and its tangent with time, their values under stress-free conditions
are shown in Table 1 as well.

In self-stress cases, the concepts of  L and  1=2 are valid
as shown in Fig. 1, but their values di'er from those in
Table 1. Hence, a value of ADC obtained from Table 1
generally di'ers from the SFDC (D0). In experiments,
the applicability of time characteristics is determined by
the techniques employed. For gas/membrane/gas and electrolyte/
membrane/gas situations,  L is easily acquired by
the measurement of pressure change; therefore, the time-lag
method has been used widely [1,2,13–24]. If an electrolyte

is introduced in the tube [16],  L can be estimated from
the potential change and  1=2 can be evaluated from the anodic
current, which re9ects the di'used 9ux. ADCs determined
by the time-lag and half-rise methods are dePned
as
Eq. (21), 
Eq. (22) respectively.

On the other hand, although the in9ection-point still exists
in self-stress experiments, it will induce negative values
of ADC using the traditional dePnition in Table 1 as
shown in Fig. 1. Therefore, we do not discuss  i and  b
afterwards.

In this work, we give only the numerical results based on
Eqs. (15)–(19) and using the frame reported earlier [33].
In the calculation, the time step is 10−6 and the space step
is 10−2, and the precision is 10−4. The time-lag under the
concentration-step condition is 0.16664 which gives a relative
error of 1:6 × 10−4 in comparison with the standard
value of 1/6. In the determination of  L and  1=2,   = 3 is
long enough to make the 9ux approach the steady value.


3. Results

In this section, we discuss the e'ects of various parameters
on ADCs under di'erent boundary conditions. Firstly,
we concentrate on the chemopotential-step situation for experiments
of gas/membrane/gas [17–22] under pressure-step
in gas phase absorption or electrolyte/membrane/gas under
potentiostatic charging in electrochemical absorption.
Secondly, the 9ux-step for electrolyte/membrane/gas with
galvanostatic charging is discussed [1,2,13–16]. Finally,
general situations between these two extreme cases are
considered.

3.1. Chemopotential-step:
The e'ects of various parameters on ADCs under
chemopotential-step boundary conditions are shown in
Fig. 2. Fig. 2(a) demonstrates an example, it is easily
found that the self-stresses make jex and Q decrease in the
initial period of hydrogen absorption (i.e. UHD) and their
increase in tube delays in comparison with the stress-free
case,  L = 0:214 and  1=2 = 0:149 are all greater than the
stress-free values and DL =0:779D0 and D1=2 =0:926D0 are
all less than D0.

Fig. 2. E'ects of various parameters on ADC under chemopotential-step boundary conditions. (a) An example of di'usion 9ux and di'used
quantity for the self-stress (solid curves) and stress-free situations (dashed curves); (b) the e'ects of self-stress factor u ; (c) contour map
of DL vs. nH;0 and QnH; (d) contour map of D1=2 vs. nH;0 and QnH. The parameters are nH;0 =0:1, QnH =n∗
H
−nH;0 =0:1, u  =20 except
for independent variables in each Pgure.

Fig. 2(b) shows the e'ects of self-stress factor u ; we
Pnd that ADCs decrease with increasing u  due to the UHD
e'ects. For one sort of metal (or alloy) and a Pxed hydrogen
concentration, the partial molar volume of hydrogen VH is
constant, so the stress-factor only changes with temperature
as indicated by Eq. (5). In other words, ADCs approach
the SFDC while the temperature is high enough and ADCs
depart from the SFDC while the temperature is low.

In9uences of initial hydrogen concentration nH;0
and chemopotential-step, which is expressed by the
concentration-step under a stress-free condition QnH=n∗
H−
nH;0, are shown in Fig. 2(c) and (d). We Pnd that ADCs
increase with increasing QnH and decrease with increasing
nH;0 as observed experimentally [20–22]. Contrary to one’s
expectation, ADCs are greater than the SFDC while nH;0
approaches zero and QnH is large as observed experimentally
[20–22], the reason for this will be given in Section 4.
When nH;0 → 0 and QnH → 0, we Pnd that DL and D1=2
approach D0 as expected.

3.2. Flux-step:
The 9ux-step situation is shown in Fig. 3. Because jex
increases more rapidly under self-stress than the stress-free
case after the initial period of hydrogen absorption (see
Fig. 3(a)),  L = 0:434 and  1=2 = 0:333 are all less than
the stress-free values; the corresponding DL =1:152D0 and
D1=2 = 1:138D0 are all greater than D0. At the same time,
ADCs increase with increasing u  as shown in Fig. 3(b).
This trend is contrary to the chemopotential-step case.

Changing of ADC with nH;0 and j0 is similar to the behaviors
of nH;0 and QnH in chemopotential-step cases as
shown in Figs. 3(c) and (d), i.e. ADCs decrease with increasing
nH;0 and increase with increasing j0. Another feature
is that ADCs are greater than the SFDC as indicated in
electrolyte/membrane/gas experiments [13–24]. Similar to
Fig. 2(c) and (d), DL and D1=2 → D0 if only both nH;0 → 0
and j0 → 0; otherwise, ADCs depart from the SFDC.

It must be pointed out, that although the time-lag method
under 9ux-step has been available for some years [29–32],
utilizing the value 1/6 but not 1/2 as  L has still appeared in
galvanostatic charging experiments [2,13,20]. This is one of
the reasons why the di'usion coe6cients of H in Pd under
electrolyte conditions are less than the value in the gas phase
experiments by about three times. However, this misleading
does not a'ect the conclusion here.

3.3. General situations:
The chemopotential- and 9ux-step are the extreme situations
based on the presumption that the surface processes are
so fast that the permeation kinetics is under di'usion control;
they can be realized by subtle surface treatments and
parameter controlments in experiments. The actual metal
(alloy) surface and bulk processes are complex [11,32–35],
for example, surface reactions (e.g. the Tafel and Heyrovsky
steps) at electrode will diminish the permeation 9ux during
hydrogen absorption [11]. This means that the surface processes
must be considered in general situations; these factors
in conjunction with the stress e'ects will induce
the measured di'usion coe6cient depart prominently from
the actual values. Sometimes, numerical simulation has to
be used to determine the di'usivity. This is the reason why
we do not compare our results with speciPc experimental
data in this work.

In the stress-free situation, we have 1=66 L61=2 and
0:1386 1=260:379 as shown in Table 1. From Figs. 2
and 3, we also Pnd that the above conclusions are valid except
for some special situations (small nH;0 and large QnH).
This means the order of di'usion coe6cient value can be
estimated even if the self-stress e'ects are involved for dilute
solid solutions (nH;0¡0:1 here).

Another similar characteristic for both boundary conditions
is that DL=D0¿1 and D1=2=D0¿1 when the applied
QnH (or j0) is large but nH;0 is very small, which means that
measurements of di'usion coe6cient must be taken with
caution even for dilute solid solutions.


4. Discussion

Changes of ADC are controlled by two opposite and
competitive factors. The Prst one is the term u nH shown
in Eq. (4) or (15), which accelerates the di'usion process
and makes ADCs greater than the SFDC [33,36]. Although
the term nH is the local value of hydrogen content
in solid, only the increment (i.e. QnH) has contributed to
the 9ux because the contribution of background (i.e. nH;0)
has been canceled out by the boundary condition. This conclusion
has also been proved by numerical simulation of
hydrogen absorbing into a plate under galvanostatic charging
[33]; it indicated that self-stress makes half-absorption
time is less than the stress-free case although some details
of the model di'er from here. This could explain the
fact ADCs increase with increasing QnH and j0 (see Figs.
2 and 3). Another factor that a'ects ADCs is the UHD,
which makes a metal membrane absorb hydrogen from gas
phase at the downstream side and the front of hydrogen 9ux
in the membrane is delayed correspondingly; thus, ADCs
may be less than the SFDC. Because self-stresses depend
on the nonuniform distribution of hydrogen content, and
the chemopotential-step will make hydrogen content at the
surface increase faster than the 9ux-step case, it is easily
understood that the chemopotential-step will have a more
prominent UHD e'ect than the 9ux-step situation. Because
the UHD e'ects increase with increasing nH;0, so ADCs
decrease with nH;0 as shown by Eq. (16) in Ref. [9].

Fig. 3. E'ects of various parameters on apparent di'usion coe6cients under 9ux-step boundary conditions. (a) An example of di'usion 9ux
and di'used quantity for the self-stress (solid curves) and stress-free situations (dashed curves); (b) the e'ects of self-stress factor u ; (c)
contour map of DL vs. nH;0 and j0; (d) contour map of D1=2 vs. nH;0 and j0. The parameters are nH;0 = 0:1, j0 = 0:1, u  = 20 except for
independent variables in each Pgure.

From Figs. 2 and 3, we Pnd that the 9ux-step with a small
charging current gives the minimum errors in measurements
of di'usion coe6cient at a nonzero of nH;0. This means that
we can obtain an ADC value close to the SFDC by this
method. In experiments [1,2,13–16], the hydrogen electrode
reaction is along the fast Volmer-slow Tafel mechanism on
Pd surface and j0 is the same as the applied current while
it is small [34]. On the other hand, the assumption of large
volume V in Eqs. (11) and (20) are easily satisPed for small
current. Therefore, usage of small current in the determination
of di'usivity of hydrogen changing with hydrogen
content is a practical method.

Although we discuss only the absorption processes,
the present methods can be extended to desorption processes
with boundary conditions adopted. The qualitative
conclusion should be the same as here except for some quantitative
modiPcations.

In the experiments, the behavior of j and Q may be complicated
by the isometric nature of vessels besides the boundary
conditions discussed in Section 3. The pressure does not
change linearly with   while it is long enough. Actually, the
di'used 9ux will reduce to zero and the pressure in the tube
will approach a steady value when the di'usion time is long
enough [11]. In the experiments, if Qp=p0 1 is not satis-
Ped while   ∼ 3, the measured ADC will di'er prominently
from the SFDC.

Another factor omitted is the interaction between hydrogen
atoms in metals (alloys) due to the conPnement of
discussion on the dilute solid solution here; otherwise, this
factor will induce the di'usivity changing with the hydrogen
concentration and the UHD e'ects will mix with the nonideal
interaction in di'usivity measurements for the metal
hydride situation [33].

On the other hand, the present theory is aimed at the
situation of tube conPgurations. For the circular plates used
widely in experiments [32,36–41], we have proved that this
model is appropriate as a primary approximation [10]; the
detailed discussion on this conPguration will be presented in
the future. For other conPgurations, e.g. spheres, cylinders
and plates, self-stresses must be treated separately according
to the speciPc situations.


5. Conclusion

In this paper, we numerically calculate ADCs of hydrogen
in thin tubular membranes determined by the time-lag
and half-rise methods under chemopotential- and 9ux-step
boundary conditions to simulate di'usivity measurements of
hydrogen in experiments based on the self-stress theory for
interstitial solutions in thin tubular shells established earlier
[9]. It is found that ADCs di'er from the SFDC when either
the initial concentration or the chemopotential (or 9ux) step
is large. Generally, ADCs are less than the SFDC under the
chemopotential-step, i.e. the pressure-step for gas absorption
or potentiostatic charging for electrochemical absorption.
However, ADCs are greater than the SFDC under the
9ux-step, i.e. the galvanostatic charging. At the same time,
we Pnd that the self-stress e'ects are proportional to the
partial molar volume of hydrogen in metals but inversely
proportional to temperature. Our results indicate that ADCs
approach the SFDC only if the initial concentration and
concentration-step (or 9ux-step) are small enough or the
temperature is high enough. In measurements of di'usion
coe6cient with nonzero hydrogen concentration (nH  = 0),
the e'ective technique is using the galvanostatic charging
with small current. Finally, our theoretical results are consistent
with the available experimental data.
