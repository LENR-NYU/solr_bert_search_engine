1. Introduction

Heat-flow calorimeters (HFCs), or heat-conduction calorimeters, are widely utilized for measurements of power and enthalpy
change during physicochemical reactions in basic research and
technical applications. Among these sorts of devices, Tian–Calvet
microcalorimeters are frequently used for tiny samples (<101 cm3)
and low powers (10−1 W) [1]. For larger samples and higher
power, other types are more suitable. One option is the Seebeck
Envelope Calorimeter (SEC) made by Thermonetics Corporation
[2]; however, this sort of device has some intrinsic defects in the
author’s experience [3]:

(1) The heat insulator around the calorimeter is insufficient; thus
the baseline and output signals oscillate daily with the ambient
temperature and drift with human activities.

(2) The device constant, the quotient of thermal power P to the output emf (electromotive force) of thermoelectric pile V, D1 = P/V,
is unstable. The author found that it shifted by 20% in three
months; the SEC had to be calibrated before and after every
measurement.

(3) The isothermality is not good. Although Tian–Calvet
microcalorimeters are semi-isothermal, the temperature
difference between the sample under test and its environment
is generally very small (<10−4 ◦C) because of small sizes and
low powers of samples. However, the isothermality may become a problem for samples of decimeter-size due to slow
heat transfer in samples, and/or across the barrier (interlayer between measuring vessel and outer layer at constant
temperature, including the thermoelectric pile and junction
parts). For example, the thermal conductance of the barrier
 = 2.44W◦C−1 for a Thermonetics SEC, this means the temperature difference reaches about 4.1 ◦C for 10W of thermal
power liberated. This non-isothermality makes the working
temperature differ prominently from the set value and this
disagreement should be avoided or reduced.

(4) The nonlinearity of the device constant is remarkable. The
device constant of Thermonetics SEC is 187.4W V−1 at 1W and
186.0W V−1 at 20W in linear approximation. This should be
partly caused by the non-isothermality of this device.

In the literature, there were also reports on large-scale custommade heat-flow calorimeters for special purposes [4,5]. These also
had, to some extent, defects like the Thermonetics SEC. Some
researchers used mass flow calorimeters [6–9]; however, this type
of calorimeter has more parameters to determine the power than
the Tian calorimeter. In this paper, we will describe a new heat-flow
calorimeter with large measuring volume and a wide power range.
Its merits are simplicity, stability, accuracy, and fewer defects than
the Thermonetics SEC. It will be useful in research on thermokinetics and thermal behavior of systems in decimeter-size.


2. Construction of calorimeter

Fig. 1 shows a schematic of the HFC. The calorimeter core consists of two embedded boxes made of an aluminum alloy. The
inner box is the measuring vessel with interior dimensions of
26 cm × 26 cm × 26 cm (17.576 dm3). The thicknesses of the inner
and outer box walls are 4 and 6 mm, respectively. Thermoelectric
modules (TM, 5.4 mm × 40 mm × 40 mm) each with 127 thermocouples, are mounted between the inner and outer walls with
screws. Thermal conductive silicone is wiped on both sides of each
TM for improving thermal conductivity. 25 TMs are distributed uniformly on each wall except for 2 facing sidewalls which have 24 TMs
because there is one hole in the center of each wall. Altogether,
148 TMs with a total of 18,796 thermocouples are used in this
calorimeter. All TMs are connected in series. The heat flow released
or absorbed during experiments is proportional to the measured
emf of TMs.

The two holes ( = 2 cm) in the two sidewalls mentioned above
permit multi-functionality of this calorimeter, i.e., controls of
mechanical, pressure and circulation of working fluid, measurements of temperature, internal resistance and voltage of the
unit-under-test (UUT). The thermal emf of the calorimeter and
other signals of UUT are measured with a Keithley 2000 multimeter
which is connected to a PC through a GPIB card, to automatically
register the data obtained using software.

The outer aluminum alloy box is wired with copper tubing
(in = 8 mm, out = 10 mm). Thermal conductive adhesive (Good
Friend®, working temperature = −3 to 235 ◦C, thermal conductivity > 1.2W m−1 ◦C−1) is used to mount the copper tubing and the
aluminum alloy walls. The outlet of copper tubing is connected with
the hose of a refrigerating/heating circulator (PolyScience 9112).
The temperature range of this circulator is −20 to 200 ◦C; the temperature stability is ±0.01 ◦C, the flow rate of the working fluid is
15–22 dm3 min−1. The inlet of the copper tubing is connected with
a small cylindrical thermostatic bath (in 20 mm × hin 50 mm); a
remote temperature probe of the circulator is placed in it. This
arrangement of temperature probe ensures the fluctuation of ambient temperature does not affect the calorimetry. The inlet of the
small bath is connected to the circulator with another hose. All
these hoses are wrapped with foam tubing to prevent heat losses.

The calorimeter core is placed in a larger box with interior
dimension of 70 cm × 70 cm × 70 cm. Heat insulation materials fill
in the gap between these two boxes. The inner surface of the large
box is covered with aluminum film, and the inner and outer walls
of the calorimeter core are connected with ground to avoid electromagnetic interference.


3. Calibration of calorimeter

Before calibration, we tested the baseline stability (noise) with
two modes of temperature control. One is remote control as
described above; another is local control, i.e. the temperature probe
was in the circulation bath but not in the HFC. We found the latter mode gave more stable baselines than the former in a short
time range and some ambient temperature dependent baselines
in a long time range, as expected. For example, the baseline was
−1.06 ± 1.23 mV at night (10 h) and −1.15 ± 2.95 mV for a 24 h day
(bath temperature was 25.00 ◦C; room temperature was 22–26 ◦C).
The remote control gave a baseline of 8.07 ± 3.81 mV over 32 h (bath
temperature was 25.00 ◦C; room temperature was 28–31 ◦C). For an
ideal calorimeter, the baseline signal should be zero or very small;
however, heat exchanges between the calorimeter and its environment cause the HFC to have a non-zero baseline, and its value drifts
slightly with room temperatures. Its magnitude can be stabilized
through control of room temperature using an air conditioner.

The calibration was conducted with a 3.6  electric heater. The
heater is made of Tophet® alloy A wire ( 0.3 mm) wound around a
cylindrical heat sink with fins, which were located at the center of
the measuring vessel. This configuration ensures a uniform distribution of temperature in air and between the heat sink and air. The
heater was connected to a DC power source (ITECH, IT6921). The
four-wire Kelvin bridge method was used to eliminate lead resistance in the measurements. Applied current was measured with a
0.1  (±0.01%) standard resistor as shunt.

A Sanyo Denki brushless fan (12 V × 0.21 A, 2.5W) with another
DC power supply (ITECH, IT6322), and a 1  (±0.01%) shunt was
used to homogenize the temperature distribution in the measuring vessel as illustrated in Fig. 1. The power of the fan was also
measured in a similar manner.

The calorimeter was calibrated from 0.1 to 50W; it gave good
linearity between thermal power and responses. One series of calibration is shown in Fig. 2. These results are simulated by a quadratic
equation: P = D0 + D1V + D2V2 = −0.0451 ± 0.0046 + (5.8954 ± 0.0025) V − (0.0019 ± 0.0003) V2 with the residual sum of squares 2 = 1.2 × 10−4 and the adjusted
R-square R2 = 1. Where P is the input power in Watts, and V is the
output emf in Volts. This simulation gives the uncertainty of 6.9%
at 0.1W, 0.6% at 2W and 0.06% at 50W. The time constant of the
HFC,  = 501.7 ± 3.2 s.

In Eq. (1), the first term D0 corresponds to the baseline signal, it
can be removed by deducting the baseline from the output emf and
its value does not affect the magnitudes of D1 and D2. The device
constant in the second term, D1 = 5.8954 ± 0.0025W V−1, or about
30 times more sensitive than the Thermonetics SEC in Ref. [3]. The
device constant did not change more than 0.6% in two years. The
quadratic term is very small, D2V/D1 = 0.3% at 50W. By comparison,
the contribution of nonlinearity: D2V/D1 = 3% for a Thermonetics
SEC [3] and 2% in Ref. [4] when the thermal power is extrapolated
to 50W.

The effect of thermal heterogeneity in the measuring vessel on
the calorimetry was tested. A heater made of straight Tophet®
alloy A wire with resistance of 6  clung to one sidewall when
power to the fan was off. The resulting device constant was
6.1071 ± 0.0176W V−1 up to 24W, which was 3.5% greater than
5.8954 ± 0.0025W V−1. This location dependence of the device constant means uniform distribution of temperature in the measuring
vessel is important for precise measurements of thermal power.

The effective heat capacity of the calorimeter was determined
by changing its outer wall temperature, C = 5.30 ± 0.02 kJ ◦C−1 from
25 to 26 ◦C, as shown in Fig. 3. In measurements of heat capacity of samples, this figure is the background of the actual value
and it should be deducted from the measured quantity. The fullwidth at the half-maximum of the pulse in Fig. 3 is 658.4 s, which
is also the response time of the HFC. The decaying part is simulated
using an exponential function. The corresponding time constant is
543.9 ± 9.0 s. These two time constants are longer than  due to
thermal processes in the outer walls being included here. Although
the above three different characteristic time constants have different values, they are close to each other and in the range of
500–660 s.

According to Ref. [1], the thermal conductance of the barrier in a Tian calorimeter is: = C  = 10.56 ± 0.11W ◦C−1

The measured value of  = 11.65 ± 0.25W◦C−1 when thermal
power changed from 2.13 to 12.58W at 25.00 ◦C. These two values are the same within the error of 10%. Their difference arises
from the measured  including not only heat capacity in a Tian
calorimeter but also thermal diffusion in HFC as mentioned above.
This reason makes the measured thermal conductance greater than
the theoretical value in Eq. (2). The  for HFC is about 5 times
that of a Thermonetics SEC. This means that this device has better
isothermality than the latter. Generally speaking, there is a balance
between sensitivity and isothermality for any calorimeter; however, the HFC has better both sensitivity and isothermality than a
Thermonetics SEC.


4. Nonlinearity of the calorimeter

The HFC described here, compared with a Tian calorimeter, has
larger measuring volume and higher power. This makes the nonlinearity of P–V relation prominent when the thermal power is high,
as shown in Eq. (1). This phenomenon can be understood from
the temperature dependence of Seebeck effects. For simplicity, the
Seebeck coefficient can approximate to: a ≈ a0 + a1T

For most thermocouples, ˛ increases with T around room temperature [10], i.e. ˛1 > 0. Therefore the output emf of the HFC is:
V = N˛T ≈ N˛0T + N˛1T2 where N = 18,796, the number of thermocouples used in HFC. T is
the temperature difference across the thermal barrier. Because the
thermal power is proportional to the temperature difference:
P = T. Eq. (4) can be expressed as
V ≈ N˛0 P + N˛1 2 P2

Solving P and expanding it to the second order gives: P ≈ N˛0V − ˛1 N2˛3 0 V2

Two constants in Eq. (3) can be obtained by combining Eqs.
(1) and (7) and parameters above: ˛0 = 0.1051 ± 0.0023 mV◦C−1
and ˛1 = 67 ± 16 nV◦C−2. Besides HFC here, Thermonetics SEC
and Storms’ calorimeter also exhibited negative values of D2 in
quadratic approximations [3,5].

Referring to Eq. (7), the ratio of the quadratic term to the linear
term in Eq. (1) is:
D2V2D1V = ˛1VN˛20≈ ˛1˛0P in the first order approximation. It is 0.27% at 50W here, one order
less than that reported in Refs. [3–5]. Eq. (8) predicts that an ideal
linearity of a HFC relies on a small temperature dependence of the
Seebeck coefficient (low value of ˛1/˛0) and good thermal conductance of the calorimeter (high value of a).


5. Test of the calorimeter

5.1. Thermal behavior of a rechargeable battery:
Calorimetry is a useful tool for measurements of heat dissipation
during charge/discharge of rechargeable batteries [11,12]. The large
volume and high power range of this calorimeter make it suitable
for studying thermal behaviors of batteries and battery modules. A
Sony 26650, MFC07P, 2700 mAh, 3.7 V, Li-ion rechargeable battery
( 26 mm × 65 mm) was used to test the calorimeter. The battery
was placed on a foam block, and one K-type thermocouple was
attached on the top center of its cylindrical surface to measure temperature. The fan in the HFC was off in the test to simulate the heat
transfer of natural convection. The induced error of thermal power
measurement is less than 3.5%, as discussed in Section 3. For evaluating the battery, over-charge and over-discharge were applied in
the experiments.

The heat dissipation during charge and discharge in the galvanostatic mode with 0.9 A (C/3) is shown in Fig. 4 and Table 1. The
surface temperature of the battery decreases in the initial period
of charge (see insert to Fig. 4(a)); this heat absorption is induced
by the entropy change and it would be observed if the charging
current was much lower than here, as illustrated in Ref. [12]. The
thermal power was less than 0.2W before the quantity of charge
reached 4500 mAh. The heat released increased sharply when the
actual charge quantity approached 5400 mAh (2 times the nominal capacity). It appeared that the battery would be in thermal
run-away, the charging was stopped intentionally.

The discharge was conducted the next day after charging with
the same current, 0.9 A (C/3), and the thermal power released was
always about 0.6W. The thermal power and temperature increased
sharply when the discharge electric quantity approached 4950 mAh
(11/12 of the charged capacity in the previous day), and the discharge was then stopped intentionally.

By comparison of parameters in charge and discharge processes,
it is found that the thermal power during discharge is about 2.5
times of that in charge. The efficiency in discharge is lower than
that in charge as shown in Table 1.

5.2. Calorimetry of Pd-D2O electrolytic cell: Thermal power is less than 1W in the above experiments.
Results will now be presented on an electrochemical process that
produced power one order higher than that of the Li-ion battery. The primary purpose of these experiments was to repeat
Fleischmann–Pons effects as was done in one earlier work [3];
however, some trivial results demonstrated the accuracy of this
calorimeter. One example of these will be presented here.

The electrolytic cell is a cylinder of borosilicate glass (in
42 mm × out 45 mm × h 142 mm). A PTFE male cap is tapered from
a hexagonal prism with side length 32 mm and thickness 13 mm at
the top, and  41 mm × 24 mm at the bottom. A groove of 4 mm
width and 2.5 mm depth was made for O-ring in the middle of
bottom part. The O-ring (in = 31.5 mm, width = 3.55 mm) made of
nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR, resistant to acid) is used to seal the
top cap against the top inner wall of glass cylinder. The top cap has
two holes, 1 mm diameter each and 20 mm apart, for the electrode
lead wires. A PTFE plate ( 41 mm × 8 mm) is used to suspend the
recombination catalyst above the electrode. It has 57 holes of
2 mm to pass gases (D2 and O2) and vapors (D2O). A PTFE rod (
6 mm × 40 mm) is fastened to the perforated plate and the top cap.
This ensures that the perforated plate is at a fixed distance above
the electrolyte.

The cathode is palladium foil, 11 mm × 31 mm × 0.5 mm, the
anode is platinum foil, 31 mm × 43 mm × 0.02 mm. Two electrode
lead wires made of Pt ( 0.8 mm × 145 mm) are covered with heatshrink teflon tubing. The electrolyte contains 51.5 g of heavy water
mixed with 8.115 g of D2SO4. Catalyst (3 g), which contains 0.5% Pt
on 1/8 inch diameter alumina pellets, is used in the cell to recombine the D2 and O2 which evolves during electrolysis. O2 gas at 1
atmosphere was flowed into the cell to accelerate catalysis. A metal
frame was used to clamp the PTFE cap onto the cell. These arrangements ensure that the electrolytic cell is a closed system. Energy
exchange occurs only during electrolysis.

The electrolysis was carried out in galvanostatic mode (3 A)
using a DC power source (ITECH IT6921), which was also used
during calibration. Fig. 5 shows the input electrolytic power
and output thermal power. The input and output powers are
8.9556 ± 0.0029 and 8.9552 ± 0.0264W, respectively, during the
stable period (5–8 h of electrolysis time). They are consistent with
each other within 0.004%, although the calorimetric error is 0.29%.

The input and output energies are 262.38 ± 0.05 and
261.83 ± 0.88 kJ, respectively. Before and after electrolysis, the cell
was weighed with Mettler PM1200; the mass loss in this run was
0.022 g. If this loss was caused by poor catalytic recombination,
the corresponding energy correction is 0.33 ± 0.03 kJ. The output
energy after correction is 262.16 ± 0.90 kJ; the resulting excess
energy is −0.22 ± 0.90 kJ, corresponding to (−0.08 ± 0.34)% of the
input energy. It means there was no excess heat produced in the
electrolytic cell and this calorimeter gave good accuracy (better
than 0.1%) at power around 9W running for 8 h.


6. Discussions

Besides applications in battery studies presented in Section
5.1, side reactions and their mechanisms in batteries can also be
studied using this calorimeter. For modules of Ni-MH rechargeable batteries, this HFC can be used to evaluate the self-discharge
directly through thermal power measurement. Furthermore, this
calorimeter can be utilized in safety and abuse evaluations of
Li-ion rechargeable battery using methods of punctuation and
short-circuit. The heat released during such processes can be measured quantitatively through making a mechanical or electric link
between the battery in the measuring vessel and control parts outside of HFC.

At the same time, this calorimeter can be used for other samples or systems in decimeter-size, e.g. fuel cells, animals, plants and
radioactive materials, to study their physiochemical, biological and
nuclear processes through thermal power measurements.

On the basis of the construction and application of HFC presented here, its advantage and uniqueness of large volume and
wide power range are obvious by comparison with a Tian–Calvet
calorimeter. Of course, the twin-cell design used in the Tian–Calvet
calorimetry [1] cannot be applied directly here due to the large volume of the measuring vessel. By comparison with a Thermonetics
SEC, its stable device constant, good isothermality and linearity are
markedly superior. At the same time, there are still defects in this
HFC; one of them is the prominent baseline signal especially when
the thermal power is less than 0.1W. This problem will be solved
in the next version of HFC.
