1. Introduction

It has long been recognized that the electrical
resistance of palladium loaded with hydrogen (taken
to include deuterium, as below) is a function of the
hydrogen content [1 /45]. This relationship is always
expressed in terms of the resistance ratio of the
palladium hydride at a particular loading (denoted by
the atom ratio, x /H/Pd) to the initial value of the free
hydrogen, i.e.: Eq. (1) as shown in Fig. 1. The relationships between xR and x
have almost the same shape for both Pd /H and Pd /D
systems but, at the same x value, the resistance is
somewhat larger for the Pd /D system, in particular in
the high x region.

The behavior of xR with changing x can be summarized
as follows. When a palladium sample begins to
absorb hydrogen, the solid solution phase, a is formed
first and the relative resistance increases almost linearly
with increasing x up to the a phase boundary composition,
xa [9 /11,21 /23]. Then the Pd /H system is in the
mixed a /b phase, xR increases less sharply with x up to
the b phase boundary composition, xb at which the
phase transition ends [1 /3,16]. With further increase of
x, the Pd /H system is in the pure b phase, the increase
rate of xR gradually decreases and reaches the maximum
xR,max at xmax [1 /4,24,30]. In the higher x region, xR
decreases sharply up to the saturation absorption at
which stoichiometric palladium hydride, PdH is formed
as was confirmed in high-pressure or low-temperature
experiments [4,27 /40].

Fig. 1. Resistance vs. loading ratio for the Pd /H [30] and Pd /D
[11,31] systems in the overall H (D) concentration range at 25 8C. The
solid squares are data from Baranowski et al. [30], the open circles are
data from Flanagan and Lewis [10] and the open squares are data from
Baranowski and Filipek [31]. The contribution to the resistance
induced by the high pressure in the original resistance data is extracted
in this figure, and the isotherm of Wicke and Nernst [46] is used to
obtain x instead of the logarithm relation between x and hydrogen
pressure in the original paper [28] which can result in x /1.

A polynomial can be used to fit xR as a function of x
in the overall hydrogen concentration region (05/x5/
1), based on the experimental data in Refs. [11,30,31,46]
(see Fig. 1) and we obtain: Eq. (2) with correlation coefficient R2 /0.999 and standard
deviation s2 /0.01086 for H, and R2 /0.9909 and
s2 /0.0318 for D. Of course, this empirical approximation
may differ from some experimental results [24,53]
especially for x near xmax due to the peaks in Fig. 1
becoming broad and gently rounded.

The behavior of xR with changing x can be explained
by the scattering theory in solid-state physics. When
hydrogen atoms are inserted into the pure palladium
lattices, the disorder increases and the number of
scattering centres for conduction electrons increases as
well; this makes the resistance increase linearly with x.
On the other hand, the pure palladium has 0.36 holes in
the d band and the s  /d scattering contributes substantially
to the resistance [32]. This d band needs 0.55 /0.60
hydrogen to fill it, so the resistance dependence for the
mixed a /b phase is of course due to the combined effect
of the opening up of the d band and the appearance of
the a and b mixture [34,35]. At high x values (x /0.6),
the PdHx looks more like an s type metal than a
transition metal, which has, in general, higher resistivity
than an s type metal, so it is easy to understand the low
resistivity of PdHx . When x approaches 1, the scattering
centers for conduction electrons are the vacancies in the
hydrogen sublattices whose number is proportional to
(1 /x) [34], so the resistance decreases with increasing x.

The actual experimental data are scattered around
those shown in Fig. 1 due to the facts below: (1) The pretreatment
of the sample influences the amplitude of xR.
Flanagan and Lewis have found that annealing the
palladium at 900 8C for 1 h results in a low xR value
whereas the quenched sample results in a high xR value
[9]. (2) Bru¨ning and Sieverts [6] and Lewis et al. [16] have
found hysteresis of the resistance ratio during the
hydriding /dehydriding process; this behavior can be
understood by the differences of xa and xb between the
absorption and desorption processes using the method
which will be discussed in Section 3.4.2. (3) The
dimensional changes of the electrode in the hydrogen
absorption and/or desorption processes affect the resistance
ratio and these changes depend on the hydriding
and/or dehydriding processes, but this was not given
sufficient attention in the past. The latter situation
forms one of the aims of this paper.

The relationship between resistance and x has been
used to infer the loading ratio in the electrolysis
experiments [47 /57]. In comparison with ex situ methods,
e.g. gravimetric determination [9], thermal analysis
[58] and coulometry [59], the resistance measurement
can monitor in situ the hydrogen content which depends
strongly on the electrochemical parameters, and hydrogen
escapes from the electrode when it is removed from
the electrolysis system. Of course, there have been other
in situ methods, e.g. the volumetric method in a closed
system [60], X-ray diffraction [61] and neutron reflectometry
[62] used in experiments, but they have inherent
defects compared with the resistance measurement. The
first technique is sensitive to impurity gases and may
overestimate the hydrogen concentration, and the latter
two methods reveal only the local but not the overall
properties, especially for a thin film sample as verified in
similar experiments [63]. The advantage of the resistance
method is that the resistance reflects the overall bulk
properties of the sample affected by the hydrogen
absorption, so it does not depend on the local characteristics
and surface impurities. At the same time it has
a small temperature dependence that can be calibrated
using the available experimental results as will be
discussed subsequently.

However, unlike the gravimetric, volumetric and
coulometric techniques, the in situ resistance measurement
(ISRM) does not give a direct measure of loading
and hence requires calibration against one of these
former techniques. This makes the reliability depend
not only on the measurement of the resistance but also
on the accuracy of the relationship between xR and x.
On the other hand, the accepted resistance data are
measured in the equilibrium or quasi-equilibrium state;
the practical hydrogen distribution is non-uniform most
of time in ISRM in the electrolysis experiments; this
non-uniformity makes the measured hydrogen concentration
differ from the average value. At the same time,
the electrolyte solution surrounding the electrode affects
the ISRM in many ways besides the co-conduction of
the measuring current through the electrolyte. The most
important effects are the additional potential shifts
caused by the measuring current and the electrolysis
current (ec). In this paper, we will discuss these problems
in turn.


2. Experimental

The electrolysis cell consisted of a glass vessel (inner f
12 /40 mm) and electrodes in a LiOH aqueous solution
( /2 ml). The cathode was made of a palladium wire (f
0.2 /50 /90 mm, 99.9% purity) wound round a PTFE
rod; each cathode end was spot-welded to two platinum
leads (f 0.2 /50 mm) for measuring H/Pd by ISRM.
The anode was made of a platinum wire (f 0.02 /100
mm) wound round another PTFE rod. All platinum
wire leads were covered with thin-walled PTFE tubes to
minimize their contact with the electrolyte and catalysis
of the H2 /O2 combination. A diaphragm was used in
the cell to separate the cathode and anode compartments
and prevents H2 and O2 combination. LiOH (1
M) aqueous solution was prepared by dissolving LiOH
(No. 3 reagent plant of Shanghai, AR) in deionized
H2O. The resistance was measured potentiometrically
with the standard four-probe technique. The measuring
currents used were 1 /100 mA; the potential drops were
measured by a Keithley 15OB microvolt ammeter.


3. Results and discussion

In this section, we will discuss some of the problems
which occurred in the ISRM. These issues can be
classified into two groups, one group including Sections
3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 is for the equilibrium state of the Pd /H
system; another one including Sections 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and
3.7 is for the non-equilibrium state which usually occurs
in the ISRM. In this work, the direct current (dc)
situation is focused on the ISRM, but most of the
conclusions can be extended to that of alternating
current except the concentration-cell effect studied in
Sections 3.5.2, 3.6.2 and 3.7. Although our aim is to
investigate the Pd/H electrode, the conclusions obtained
in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 can be extended to the
Pd/H2 system and all of the results can be applied to the
Pd/D electrode or the Pd/D2 system with some parameters
modified.

3.1. Resistivity ratio: From the viewpoint of physics, a resistivity ratio
should be more fundamental to characterize the change
of hydrogen concentration than the resistance ratio xR
although the latter is always used in experiments.
Similar to the concept of xR in Eq. (1), we define the
resistivity ratio:
Eq. (3)
with rPdH
x
and rPd being the resistivities of PdHx and
Pd, respectively. xr is also a function of x and has a
similar shape to that of xR shown in Fig. 1. The
difference arises from the expansion effect in the
hydrogen insertion into the palladium lattice. It was
supposed that a sample expansion is uniform in all three
dimensions in past work [32,34,41], but this is not the
case in practice. The actual dilation of a PdHx sample
has two extreme situations according to whether the
internal stresses arising from an inhomogeneous distribution
of hydrogen (including phase transitions) in
the absorption and/or desorption processes are removed
or not, i.e. the coherence and incoherence expansions1.
For the coherence situation, the lattices distort but do
not crack so the expansion is uniform in all directions.
In contrast, the internal stresses are released by plastic
deformation in the small size direction (radius for a rod
and thickness for a plate) but the large size direction
(length for a rod, radius for a circular plate, and width
and length for a rectangular plate) changes very little in
the incoherence situation. For a general case, the
expansions are between these two states. Consider a
sample with uniform cross-section S and length l /S1/2;
the resistances in these three situations are:
Eq. (4), with 
Eq. (5) where oV is the partial volume of H in Pd expressed as
the volume fraction; its average value in the overall
hydrogen concentration region is 0.162 and 0.157 for H
and D, respectively [64,65]. ol is the partial length
change. Combining Eqs. (1), (3) and (4) gives:
Eq. (6) with the correction factor:
Eq. (7), oRx versus x is shown in Fig. 2. It is seen that the
acquisition of the resistivity ratio from the resistance
ratio depends on the internal stress-state of hydrogen in
palladium, hence the correction factor changes from 5.4
to 16.2% for PdH. This result also indicates that the
resistance ratios obtained under different conditions
may differ from each other by as much as 2oVx/3,
which is 10.8% for PdH. The general situation is a
mixture of these two cases so we have oV/35/oR5/oV
and the value of oR depends on the preparation process
of the PdHx sample. In the hydrogen absorption and/or
desorption processes at room temperature, the al/b
phase transition results in plastic deformation and
creation of dislocations [66,67], so the incoherence
situation is unavoidable in the main region of hydrogen
concentration. On the other hand, the mixed a /b phase
is overcome while the applied hydrogen pressure is
slowly stepped up by small increments at high temperatures
in some experiments [56]; it is then in the coherence
situation.

In experiments, the correction factor oR can be
obtained by the measurements of resistance, dimensions
and hydrogen content of PdHx in conjunction. It is a
pity that this result has not been obtained up to now
although the dimensional changes in the hydrogen
absorption and/or desorption processes were monitored
in early work such as that in Refs. [3,5,68,69] and other
work cited in Ref. [70], so we have to use the dimensional
change alone to obtain oR. Graham has observed
that the length of a Pd wire was elongated by 1.605% by
an accompanying hydrogen absorption change to x 
0.677 [68], this result corresponds to ol /2.37%; and the
data in work by Fischer [5] gives ol /3.32%. These two
results give oR /10.5% and this situation is also shown
in Fig. 2 as the ‘usual case’.

resistance ratio. The dotted, solid and dashed lines are for the
coherence, incoherence and usual cases of internal stress of H in Pd,
respectively (detailed explanation can be found in Section 3.1).

3.2. Effect of temperature on the PdHx resistance: 
Besides the experimental results on xR versus x
around room temperature (TR) such as those shown in
Fig. 1, there is also similar work at other temperatures
[6 /8,10,14 /17,19 /21,24 /26,32 /43]. However, most of
results are concentrated on very low temperatures due to
the phenomenon of superconductivity of PdHx (and
PdDx) with x]/0.8 at TB/12 K found in 1972 [71 /74]
and the anomaly of resistance and specific heat around
50 K with x around 0.6 found in 1957 [41,75 /78].
Although some data on the temperature effect around
TR are available [10,17], a systematic study on the
overall hydrogen concentration has not been carried out
to date. Therefore we have to deduce the temperature
coefficient from different results obtained by different
authors [10,17,30,34] as is shown in Fig. 3.

In Fig. 3(a), the temperature coefficient of resistivity
r ?PdH
x
,T around TR with x5/0.685 is obtained using the
data of Flanagan and Lewis [10] at 0 8C and McNicholl
and Lewis [17] at 65 8C; r ?PdH
x
,T with x]/0.87 is
obtained using the data of Baranowski et al. [30] at
25 8C and Burger et al. [34] at  /77 8C. The expansion
effect discussed above is considered in the calculation of
r ?PdH
x
,T using the correction factor of the usual case. As
a polynomial approximation, the data shown in Fig.
3(a) are fitted by the expression below: Eq. (8) with R2 /0.9258 and s2 /0.1478. The resistivity ratio
around TR is: Eq. (9)

Fig. 3. The temperature coefficient of resistivity (a) and resistance (b)
of PdHx around room temperature. The open squares are data of
Flanagan and Lewis [10]; the solid squares are data calculated from
those of Flanagan and Lewis [10] at 0 8C and McNicholl and Lewis
[17] at 65 8C; the solid circles are data obtained from Baranowski et
al. [30] at 25 8C and Burger et al. [34] at  /77 8C. All the data in (a)
have been corrected for the expansion effect.

From Fig. 3(a), we find r ?PdH
x
,T exhibits complex
behavior with x. The maximum value appears in the
mixed a /b phase as was observed experimentally [3]:
this can be interpreted by the percolation theory [40], i.e.
r ?PdH
x
,T in the mixed a /b phase is greater than values
in the a and b phases. This makes the maximum value of
xr (or xR) flatten at high temperatures [20]. Because the
a and b phases may have different profiles in a sample
(see Section 3.4.2) and the phase boundary compositions
xa and xb change with temperature, it is easy to
understand that the data in this region are severely
scattered. Another fact which has been neglected before
is that r ?PdHx,T in the high x region increases with x due
to the optic-mode phonon of H in PdHx , and this opticmode
contribution makes the resistivity of PdD greater
than that of PdH as is shown in Fig. 1. Although the
data in Fig. 3(a) are for hydrogen, deuterium shows an
almost identical result according to Ref. [41].

A convenient quantity, widely used in experiments, is
the temperature coefficient of resistance aR defined as a
dimensionless quantity [10,53,54]:
Eq. (10). It is shown in Fig. 3(b) based on the same data in Fig.
3(a) [10,17,30,34]; the polynomial approximation to
these data is:
Eq. (11) with R2 /0.98833 and s2 /0.09656. The resistance ratio
around TR can be normalized to that at room temperature:
Eq. (12)

As experimentally, the temperature may change from
time to time, the x value can be obtained by combining
Eq. (12), the data of xR(TR) and aR by using the
iterative method because aR is also a function of x it is
not necessary to find out xR(T). Another convenient
way to determine x is by acquiring the resistance ratio of
PdHx at any temperature to Pd at TR:
Eq. (13)

By plotting xR(T, TR) at different temperatures, the x
value can be obtained directly from these graphs. Of
course, TR in Eqs. (12) and (13) may not necessarily be
298.15 K in experiments; it can be any temperature as
set initially.

Flanagan and Lewis [10] and Barton et al. [14] have
studied xR(T) at T /0 /55 8C with 05/x5/0.685 and
the corresponding xR has been used in past experiments
[53,54]. The data of Flanagan and Lewis [10] are also
shown in Fig. 3 (open squares). Because of the narrow
range of temperature which induces xR changes of less
than 5% and the inherent large error in the mixed a /b
phase, the data are scattered and the relative error is
significant.

3.3. Effect of hydriding /dehydriding cycles on the initial
resistance of palladium:
It is well known that if a Pd sample is hydrided and
then dehydrided a number of times, i.e. ‘cycled’, the
sample shape will deform strongly [1]. This deformation
also affects the Pd resistance as was verified in our
experiments and shown in Fig. 4. It is found that the RPd
decreases almost linearly with the number of cycle. As a
primary explanation, this effect can be understood by
the dimensional changes during the hydriding /dehydriding
cycles. Because self-stresses developed in a
hydriding process are released by the expansion in the
small size direction as discussed in Section 3.1 and this
change is irreversible [3,69,79], the small size increases,
the large size decreases and the overall volume changes
slightly after one cycle. For a sample with uniform
cross-section S and length l /S1/2, we have:
Eq. (14) in one cycle, where dVPd, dSPd and dlPd denote the
changes of volume, cross-section and length of Pd
sample after one hydriding /dehydriding cycle, respectively.
We define the length change: Eq. (15) in one cycle, the length after n cycles is: Eq. (16)

Fig. 4. Experimental results on the initial resistance of palladium after
seven cycles of hydriding /dehydriding. The linear fit to results gives:
RPd,n /0.1027(1 /1.607% n ) V and 0.1027(1 /2.775% n) V for samples
A and B, respectively. Both two samples are 0.02 cm in diameter and
ca. 3 cm in length.

Similarly, we obtain the resistance change after one
cycle:
Eq. (17)

Besides the dimensional changes, dislocations, cracks
and voids are produced within the cycled sample [79 /
84], and these defects will cause an increase of the
resistance although its magnitude is less than that
caused by the dimensional change. To account for the
overall effect on the resistance after one cycle, we use gR
to replace 2gl . Integrating Eq. (17) with respect to n, we
obtain the Pd resistance after n cycles:
Eq. (18)

If n is small this expression can be approximated by a
linear function:
Eq. (19)

Experimental results are shown in Fig. 4 and we find
that gR /1.61 and 2.78% for samples A and B,
respectively. Referring to the data in Ref. [68], the
length of a Pd wire shrank from 609.144 to 585.154 mm
after four cycles, which corresponds to gl /0.98% from
Eq. (16). Other similar data were obtained using a
rectangular plate [80], the plate area of 6.0 /2.5 cm2
diminished to 1.12 /0.53 cm2 after 92 cycles and we
obtain gl /1.82 and 1.69% from Eq. (16). It can be
proved that Eq. (16) is suitable for both cylindrical and
rectangular shapes. These three sets of results are
qualitatively consistent with each other and they indicate
that the initial resistance must be measured after
each cycle of hydriding /dehydriding. Even if the phase
transition may not be complete in the hydrogen
absorption-desorption processes, the initial electrode
resistance also changes and its decrease depends on the
extent of phase transition.

3.4. Effect of hydrogen concentration distribution on the
PdHx resistance ratio: In this subsection, we will discuss theoretically the
effect of non-uniform distribution of hydrogen concentration
in PdHx on the sample resistance: we call it the
non-uniform effect. Consider a measuring current flowing
through a PdHx sample with length l and uniform
cross-section S, and the current direction is in the length
direction. The non-uniform effect has two extreme
situations in ISRM: one is that x changes in the
direction perpendicular to length, e.g. a thin wire
absorbs the hydrogen and the measuring current flows
from one end to the other. The overall resistance is the
parallel of those of thin layers in the length direction:
Eq. (20). We denote this situation as case p. Another extreme
situation is that x changes only in the length direction,
e.g. the concentration-cell effect induces x to change in
the current direction as will be discussed afterwards. The
total resistance is the series of those of thin layers
perpendicular to the length direction:
Eq. (21). We denote this situation as case s. Then, what we need
to do is to discuss these two extreme situations: other
complex cases are a mixture of these and the resistance is
a value somewhere between RPdH
x
,p and RPdH
x
,s.

Referring to Fig. 1, the regions of hydrogen concentration
in the resistance graph can be divided into four
parts: (1) the a phase; (2) the mixed a /b phase; (3) the b
phase with x near xmax and (4) the b phase with x near
1. We will discuss the profile effect of these four aspects.

3.4.1. The a phase: For the a phase, it was found that:
Eq. (22) with the coefficient A1 /2.41 /3.7 for H [21 /23] and 4.1
for D [11]. First, we discuss the non-uniform effect in
case p. Combining Eqs. (1), (3), (4), (20) and (22) gives:
Eq. (23) with 
Eq. (24)

For simulating the practical case, we consider a
cylindrical PdHx sample with radius r0 and length l
which has been loaded with uniform hydrogen concentration
x0 as the initial value; the hydrogen concentration
is switched to x1 at r /r0 and time t /0. x at any
time and place is [85]:
Eq. (25) where an is the nth root of the Bessel function of the first
kind of order zero, i.e. J0(an ) /0; r is the radial
coordinate; tr /Dt/r0 2 , is the reduced diffusion time in
the radial direction, where D is the diffusion coefficient
of H in Pd. Similarly to the deduction of Eq. (23), the
effective resistance and the effective x value measured
by ISRM can be obtained from Eq. (22). Fig. 5 shows an
example of this situation with x0 /0 and x1 /0.1. The
average hydrogen concentration at a time is [85]:
Eq. (26) / ¯ x and the relative error are also shown in Fig. 5. We find
that the maximum error appears in the initial period as
expected.

For the case s, by combining Eqs. (1), (3), (4), (21) and
(22), we have:
Eq. (27)

For simulating this situation, we consider that the
cylindrical sample absorbs hydrogen at the two end
faces; hydrogen atoms diffuse in the axial direction with
the first boundary condition as discussed above. The
hydrogen concentration at any time and place is [85]:
Eq. (28) where z is the axial coordinate; tl /Dt/l2, is the reduced
diffusion time in the axial direction. The resistance can
be obtained by introducing this equation into Eqs. (1),
(3), (4), (21) and (22), and the effective hydrogen
concentration is obtained by solving Eq. (22). The
average hydrogen concentration in this situation is [85]:
Eq. (29)

Fig. 5. Resistance ratio, average hydrogen concentration and relative
error of the resistance method in the a phase during the diffusion
process. The parameters: x0 /0, x1 /0.1, A1 /2.41.

A related example is also shown in Fig. 5. In this case,
the measured x is exactly the average value due to the
linear nature of Eqs. (21) and (22).

For a general form of hydrogen distribution, the total
resistance is between RPdH
x
,p and RPdH
x
,s, so the relative
error arising from the non-uniform effect is:
Eq. (30). This result indicates that the measured hydrogen content
is some less than the average value although the error is
not substantial.

In this and the subsections below, we give examples of
hydrogen diffusion only under the first boundary
condition. It should be noted that actual situations are
more complicated than here; the H concentration
distribution depends on the bulk and surface properties
of the electrode and the applied potential or current in
electrochemical charging. However, the examples here
give the limiting case because the surface process, which
is always the rate-determining step, is very fast under the
first boundary condition.

3.4.2. The a + b phase: For the mixed a + b phase, it has been verified by
STM that the b phase is first formed near the outer
surface of a Pd wire and the a0/b phase transition
accompanies the shrinkage of the a j b interface in the
electrochemical charging process [57]. This means that
the sample resistance can be seen as the parallel of the
resistances of two single phases and the corresponding
resistance ratio is:
Eq. (31) where xR, a and xR, b are the resistance ratios while x /
xa and xb, respectively. If the two phases occupy
different length regions, the overall resistance is the
series of those in two singles phases:
Eq. (32)

Fig. 6. (a) Resistance ratio of PdHx in the mixed a /b phase, the
scattered points are experimental results cited from Flanagan and
Lewis [10] and the solid lines are theoretical results calculated from
Eqs. (31) and (32); (b) the relative error in the mixed a /b phase. The
parameters: xa /0.0247, xb /0.596, xa /1.056, xb /1.654.

If the mixed a /b phase is composed of homogeneously
dispersed granules of the a and b phases, the
overall resistance can be seen as an appropriate average
between the resistances of the pure a and b phases as
interpreted by the percolation theory [40,43]. A comparison
between the experiment results [10] and Eqs. (31)
and (32) is illustrated in Fig. 6(a), where it is shown that
the actual resistance ratio xR is between the values of
xR,p and xR,s. Generally speaking, in determining x by a
given resistance ratio xR, we obtain the relative error by
Eqs. (31) and (32):
Eq. (33)
where xp and xs are the x values determined by Eqs. (31)
and (32), respectively. Fig. 6(b) shows d vs. x in the
mixed a /b phase region. We find the maximum error
can be as large as 30%, so in determining the hydrogen
concentration one must be cautious. The above conclusion
is obtained from the hydrogen absorption process,
and can be applied to the hydrogen desorption process
with the characteristic values in Eqs. (31) /(33) being
replaced by the corresponding quantities in the b0/a
phase transition.

3.4.3. The b phase with x near xmax:
When the resistance ratio is near the maximum value
xmax, its change with x can be expanded about the point
xmax by a power series to the second order:
Eq. (34)

Similarly to the discussion in Section 3.4.1, we obtain
the resistance ratio for both cases p and s:
Eq. (35) and the relative error is:
Eq. (36)

This equation indicates that the measurement error
will be much great when ¯ x is close to xmax or the
concentration distribution is far from uniform. An
example of case p is shown in Fig. 7, where the
resistance is obtained by using Eqs. (1), (3), (4), (20)
and (34). Contrary to the empirical expectation, the
measured hydrogen concentration is quite different from
the practical value especially when ¯ x nears xmax as
shown by Eq. (36). This result also indicates that care is
needed in the determination of hydrogen concentration
around the maximum resistance region. In the numerical
calculation, the diffusion coefficient is understood as the
average value over a narrow range of hydrogen concentration
because it actually changes with x in the b
phase [86 /88]. The case s is similar to the case p, so these
results are not shown.

3.4.4. The b phase with x near 1:
When x approaches 1, the resistance ratio decreases
sharply with x.We can expand xR around the point x /
1 (stoichiometric palladium hydride):
Eq. (37)

Fig. 7. Average hydrogen concentration ¯ xp; resistance ratio xp and the
induced hydrogen content xp in the hydrogen concentration region
near xmax during hydrogen diffusion. The parameters: xmax /1.822,
xmax /0.75, A2 /7.5, A3 / /6 (for the convenience of determining x,
the polynomial series in Eq. (34) is expanded to the third order), x0 /
0.7 and x1 /0.8.

Similar to the above discussion, we obtain the
resistance ratio for case p in the second order approximation:
Eq. (38) and the resistance ratio for case s in the second order
approximation:
Eq. (39). The relative error under a general case is:
Eq. (40)

Fig. 8 shows numerical results based on Eqs. (1), (3),
(4), (20), (21) and (37) for both cases. We find a
substantial error appears only at the beginning, and
the maximum error is less than 1%. These results are
consistent with Eq. (40) and this indicates that the
ISRM is effective in the high x region.

In a word, although the non-uniform distribution of x
may induce some errors, the most prominent effects on
the determination of x by ISRM mainly occur while
xaB/xB/xb or x is near xmax. These defects can be
avoided by controlling the electrolysis current density
(ecd) in the electrochemical hydrogen charging, e.g. the
resistance can be treated as case p for the mixed a /b
phase region while the ecd is high and the error will be
very little in the phase region when small ecd steps are
applied.

It seems that the expansion effect discussed in Section
3.1 is omitted in this section. Actually, it is shown that
the contributions of the correction factor cancel each
other out.

3.5. Effect of electrolyte on the PdHx resistance in the in
situ measurement:
In the ISRM of the PdHx electrode, the surrounding
electrolyte, the applied ec and the electrode configuration
itself all influence the resistance measurements.
First, the solution acts as a resistance in parallel with the
electrode and the apparent PdHx resistance is reduced
when co-conduction is in progress. Second, the potential
drop across the electrode induced by the measuring dc
makes it behaves as a concentration-cell, which contributes
an additional potential shift to the signal
measured. Thirdly, the ec contributes another potential
drop to the electrode by the current collection into the
electrode and the concentration-cell effect. Finally, the
lead electrode exposed to the electrolyte or other defects
in the electrode configuration and design can influence
the ISRM due to the concentration-cell effect. Although
some of these factors have been studied experimentally
[50 /52], a detailed and complete consideration has been
lacking up to now. In this and the subsections below, we
will study these problems theoretically in turn. First of
all, let us discuss the effect of the electrolyte solution on
the ISRM.

3.5.1. Co-conduction of electrolyte:
The co-conduction of the electrolyte can be seen as
the resistance that is in parallel with the electrode. There
are three configurations for an electrode with length l
and radius r0 as shown in Fig. 9 (a); the first is a straight
rod, which we call shape I as it is in the shape of this
letter and this was used in most previous experiments
[52 /57]. The second is a spiral electrode as used in the
present work, which we call shape W. The third is an
electrode bent in the shape of a letter U; the noninduction
loop used in Refs. [49 /51] is of this type.
Other situations can be considered as a combination of
these. For the shape I, the solution resistance can be
seen as the series resistance of two hemispheres with
radius r0; for the shape W, the resistance is equivalent to
the series resistance of coaxial circles with diameter dW
that is much greater than r0; for the shape U, the
electrolyte resistance is equal to the resistance between
two long parallel wires with length l /2, radius r0 and
distance dU /r0. Their resistances are easily obtained
from a textbook of electromagnetics: Eq. (41)
where rS is the resistivity of solution. The additional
resistance contribution to that of a PdHx electrode by
the co-conduction of the solution, RA,S can be expressed
as: Eq. (42)

Fig. 9. Schematic diagram of a PdHx wire electrode used in the
resistance measurement. (a) Electrodes of shapes I, W and U,
respectively; (b) the magnification representation of the electrode used
in the measurement and electrolysis process. r0 and l are radius and
length of the electrode, respectively; IM and IE are the measurement
and electrolysis currents in the z direction, respectively; electrolysis
current density jE is distributed uniformly on the electrode and is
collected at z /l .

For example, l /r0 /102, dW/r0 /dU/r0 /10, rPdH
x
 /
10 5 V cm and rS /10 V cm and the amplitudes of
RA,S/RPdH
x
are 10 4, 4.3 /10 4 and 2.2 /10 3 for
shapes I, W and U, respectively. From Eq. (42), we find
that a long and/or thin electrode, good conduction of
the solution will give a significant co-conduction effect
as expected.

3.5.2. Concentration-cell effect in the resistance
measurement:
Knorr and Schwartz [47,48] and Carson et al. [49 /51]
have found that the apparent PdHx resistance drifts
upward to a larger value when a measuring dc passes
through a sample immersed in electrolyte. This phenomenon
can be interpreted by the concentration-cell effect
[49 /51]. When a potential difference is applied between
the two ends of the electrode, the loss of hydrogen from
the positive electrode will result in an electrode potential
above 0 V and simultaneously the electrode potential of
the negative electrode will correspondingly decrease
below 0 V. Proton transfer ceases, apart from the leak
current, when the potential developed between the two
ends equals the applied potential. The final concentration
of hydrogen in the electrode may be calculated from
the available relationship between hydrogen content and
electrode potential. At the same time, this polarization
will contribute an additional potential fall, which makes
the apparent resistance greater than the actual value. We
will discuss this effect quantitatively below.

Consider a measurement current IM passing through
an electrode as shown in Fig. 9(b); the electromotive
force (emf) of the concentration-cell is the potential drop
IMRPdH
x
, which is built up over a period time [50] and
can be expressed as:
Eq. (43) as shown in Fig. 10(a), where the fraction 1/2 in the
parentheses ensures that the average potential is zero.
The emf makes the hydrogen concentration in the
electrode redistribute in the current direction. From
the isotherm of hydrogen in the b phase PdHx electrode
[46,89,90], we have:
Eq. (44) where mH,0 is the chemical potential of hydrogen in the
reference state, Ub /49 kJ mol 1, is the H /H interaction
energy [46] and the other symbols have their usual
meanings. We can obtain the concentration departure
from the average value at a point by the differential of
Eq. (44) with respect to potential:
Eq. (45) with
Eq. (46) and f /F/RT. The numerical example is shown in Fig.
10(b). Introducing Eq. (45) into Eq. (24) gives the
standard deviation:
Eq. (47)

Fig. 10. The concentration-cell effect induced by the measurement
current. (a) The potential distribution; (b) the hydrogen concentration
distribution; (c) the current distribution and (d) the current density
distribution in the PdHx electrode in the current direction. jM /IM/
2pr0l . Parameter: k /1.

For example, for RPdH
x
 /10 1 V, IM /10 1 A, Ub/
RT /18.1 and ¯ x/ /0.7, we obtain s2 /1.4 /10 3 which
is much less than the average value, so the concentration
redistribution does not induce any noticeable error as
was concluded from the discussion in Section 3.4.

The overall emf is comprised of the ohmic potential
drop of the external circuit (i.e. the PdHx electrode
itself) DEPdH
x
,C, the ohmic polarization of the inner
resistance (i.e. the electrolyte solution) DES,C and the
electrochemical overpotential hC. The potential drop
across the small distance dz at point z in the PdHx
electrode is:
Eq. (48)

The electrolyte resistance in the small distance dz can
be seen as the resistance of a part of the cylindrical
electrode with radius r0 and surface area 2pr0dz in the
solution for the shapes I and W or the resistance of two
parallel electrodes with distance dU and length dz for the
shape U. These two situations can be treated individually
as:
Eq. (49) with
Eq. (50) RS,C is equivalent to the resistance between two parallel
wires with length 4l , radius r0 and distance l for shapes I
and W, or distance dU for shape U. By comparison with
Eq. (41), we find that RS,C is much less than RS. Using
the parameters in Section 3.5.1 and l /10 cm, we obtain
RS,C /0.73 V for shapes I and W, and 0.37 V for shape
U.

From the relationship between the overall ecd jE and
overpotential h on the Pd/H electrode [89,90], we
obtain:
Eq. (51)
where j0V and j0T are the exchange current densities of
the Volmer and Tafel reactions, b is the stoichiometric
number of the electrochemical reaction and it is
connected with the Tafel slop b by the relation b /
2.303/bf . The symbol of the absolute value in this
equation ensures that the anodic and cathodic processes
are expressed by a unified form. Eq. (51) is more
empirical than fundamental because the actual overpotential-
ecd relation is complex [89,90]. In general, b is
between 0 and 2 and its value depends on the mechanism
of the electrode reaction. For the hydrogen evolution
reaction (her), b /2 when the reaction follows the fast
Volmer /slow Tafel mechanism, b /1/3 when the reaction
follows the coupled Volmer /Tafel mechanism and
b /0 when the ecd approaches the limiting value. For
the anodic oxide reaction, 0B/bB/2 [89]. In this paper,
the sign of jE is determined by the direction of the ec
relative to the measuring dc in the electrode as shown in
Fig. 9(b). If they are in the same direction (i.e. IE/IM /
0), jE /0; otherwise, jEB/0 while IE/IMB/0. This choice
of sign differs from the conventional treatment where
the positive and negative ecds are for the anodic and
cathodic processes, respectively.

The overpotential of the concentration-cell can be
obtained by the differential of the ecd with respect to h:
Eq. (52) with the current density of the concentration-cel
Eq. (53) and
Eq. (54)

The potential at point z is the sum of the above three
terms:
Eq. (55)

This equation can be simplified to an ordinary
differential equation of second order:
Eq. (56) with
Eq. (57),
Eq. (58) and
Eq. (59)

The effective internal resistance RC is composed of
two terms: one is the resistance of solution, RS,C, as
shown in Eq. (50) and the other is the polarization
resistance, Rh,C. The polarization resistance depends on
the exchange current density of the Volmer reaction and
the ecd as shown in Eq. (54). When jE is great enough
the polarization resistance will be very small. Applying
the boundary condition:
Eq. (60). We obtain the solution of Eq. (56):
Eq. (61) and the current density of the concentration-cell from
Eq. (53):
Eq. (62) with
Eq. (63) 

Of course, the definition jM has only a formal meaning.
The potential drop contributed to the PdHx
electrode is:
Eq. (64) with the definition of h(k) and its series expansion to the
fourth order
Eq. (65) 

It is 0.0926 for the parameter in Fig. 10. The
additional resistance contributed to the original value
induced by the measuring dc is:
Eq. (66)

Referring to Eqs. (50), (54), (58), (59), (65) and (66),
we find there are many factors that can influence RPdH
RC and hence RA,M. The first factor as usually expected
is the conduction of the electrolyte; a high conduction of
electrolyte results in small RS,C and RC (see Eqs. (50)
and (58)), and a large RA,M as is observed experimentally
[50]. Contrary to one’s expectation, the size,
configuration and surface properties of the electrode
also affect RS,C, RC and RA,M, e.g. a long wire induces a
large value of RA,M and this is one of the reasons for the
high value of RA,M observed by Carson et al. [50]
although they had not predicted it. An electrode with a
rough surface results in a large value of j0V, hence large
values of j0C, small values of RC and high values of RA,M
(see Eqs. (54), (58) and (65)). At the same time, some
additives such as H2S and thiourea can inhibit the
reaction rate of the Pd/H electrode, so it is easy to
understand that they can diminish RA,M as is observed
experimentally [50]. Another factor is the ecd; a large
ecd results in high values of j0C and RA,M similar to the
effect of j0V. Because the ecd will induce an additional
resistance as will be discussed in the subsection below,
the effect of the ecd on the ISRM is more complex than
expected.

On the other hand, if the electrode radius is very small
or the length is very large, l /r0 will be very great and the
co-conduction of the solution will be substantial as is
shown in Eq. (42). In this case, the effects of the
electrolyte solution will be complicated. First, the coconduction
reduces the measurement resistance and
hence the potential drop across the electrode. Second,
the concentration-cell effect will be noticeable and the
apparent resistance should be greater than the actual
value. Therefore, this situation should be avoided in
experiments.

The above discussion is suitable only if the measuring
current is not high enough; otherwise, the hydrogen gas
produced at the negative end cannot convert to atomic
hydrogen at the positive end and the system is not
reversible as was observed experimentally [50].

3.6. Effect of electrolysis current on resistance
measurement:

It is well known that the electrolysis process will
disturb the electrode resistance measurement when the
dc method is used [52]. To cancel this interference, a
delta-mode current has been used to eliminate the
deviation [52,54]. In this subsection we will discuss two
aspects of the potential drop and additional resistance
caused by the ec: one is that every electrode also acts as a
current collector and hence bears a potential fall in the
electrolysis process; the other is the concentration-cell
effect induced by this potential shift.

3.6.1. Potential drop caused by the electrolysis current:
In the ISRM of the electrode in the electrolysis
process, the ec that is collected in the electrode will
contribute a potential drop to the measuring signal
because the electrode has a resistance (see Fig. 9(b)). As
a first approximation [91], we suppose that the ec (IE) is
uniformly distributed on the electrode. From a small
distance dz at a point z as shown in Fig. 9(b), we obtain
the relationship between the increment of current in the
electrode and jE:
Eq. (67) where the ecd jE is related to IE by:
Eq. (68)

The potential drop across the small distance dz is:
Eq. (69)

Combining these three equations and integrating
dEPdH
x
,E with respect to z, we obtain the potential at
a point z caused by the electrolysis current collection:
Eq. (70) as shown in Fig. 11(a), where the fraction 1/3 in the
parentheses ensures that the average potential is zero.
The corresponding potential drop across the electrode
is:
Eq. (71). This means that the electrode behaves as that with a half
value of the original resistance.

Fig. 11. The concentration-cell effect induced by the electrolysis
current. (a) The potential distribution; (b) the hydrogen concentration
distribution; (c) the current distribution and (d) the current density
distribution in the PdHx electrode in the current direction. Parameter:
k /1.

Of course, the above conclusion is appropriate only
when the ecd is uniformly distributed in the length
direction (but radial symmetry need not be applied, in a
general situation, 2pr0 in Eq. (68) should be replaced by
the rod perimeter); this assumption is difficult to
preserve when H2 bubbles are produced and the ecd
increases in the her [92,93]. However, DEPdH
x
,E must not
be greater than IRPdH
x
which means that the ec is so
non-uniform that it is concentrated only at one end.

3.6.2. Concentration-cell effect caused by the electrolysis
current:
Because the ec contributes a potential drop between
the ends of electrode, it also has a concentration-cell
effect as discussed in Section 3.5.2. First, we give the
hydrogen concentration departure from the uniform
distribution by replacing EC in Eq. (45) with EPdH
x
,E in
Eq. (70): Eq. (72) with g(x) defined in Eq. (46), the hydrogen distribution
is shown in Fig. 11(b). Introducing Eq. (72) into Eq. (24)
gives the standard deviation:
Eq. (73). For example for IE /10 1 A and other parameters
being the same as in the discussion of Eq. (47), we have
s2 /7.5 /10 4 which is much less than x¯:

Similarly to Eq. (56), we obtain an ordinary differential
equation of second order:
Eq. (74). The solution is:
Eq. (75) and
Eq. (76)

The potential shift contributed to the external circuit
is:
Eq. (77)

The corresponding additional resistance contributed
to the measurement value is the sum of these resistances
caused by the electrolysis current collection and its
concentration-cell effect as shown in Eqs. (71) and (77):
Eq. (78)

From this equation, it is found that the contribution
of the electrolysis process to the ISRM depends on the
direction and magnitude of the ec in addition to the
factors discussed in Section 3.5.2. If the ec is in the
direction of the measuring dc in the PdHx electrode, i.e.
IE/IM /0, it will contribute another positive shift besides
RA,M to the measured resistance. Otherwise, it will
diminish the magnitude of the measured value when
IE/IMB/0. In experiments, its influence can be avoided
through an appropriate choice of the measuring current.
If the measuring current is much greater than the ec,
RA,E will be 
/RA,M and RA,E can be omitted. On the
other hand, we can use the delta-mode current; i.e. at
time t1 for the positive current and at t2 for the negative
current, the compensated value (Vt 1 /Vt 2)/2 ensures
that the true value is readily displayed. The current
direction changes periodically and this delta mode can
be programmed using the front panel controls. Of
course, the magnitude of IM must not be much less
than IE in this case; otherwise, the error will be very
marked because (Vt 1 /Vt 2)/2 is a subtraction of two
large numbers, Vt 1 and Vt 2.

It must be pointed out that DEPdH
x
,E appears
instantly when the ec is applied, whereas DEPdH
x
,C is
delayed by a time interval which depends on the
electrode diameter and surface properties [49 /51].

The above deduction is for the perfect electrode. In
the practical case there are two factors causing the
results to depart from the ideal value. One is that the
electrode resistance RPdH
x
is of the same order as the
solution resistance RS; the ecd on electrode is nonuniform
and it changes with position as discussed in
Ref. [91]. The other is that H2 gas bubbles produced on
the erect PdHx electrode in the her make the ecd in the
bottom region greater than that in the top region, hence
the non-uniformity of the ecd increases. These two
situations make the magnitude of RA,E differ from, but
not go beyond twice the value of RA,E in Eq. (78).
Because the extremely inhomogeneous cases are that the
overall ec passes from one end to the other, as does the
measuring current, or only passes through one end, so
we have:
Eq. (79)

When the ecd is very high, the volume and number of
H2 bubbles adhering to the PdHx surface will be so
numerous that bubbles are positioned closer and finally
interfere with each other and impede the solution
contact with the electrode. The system becomes electrically
unstable since no definite potential can be linked
to the ecd [92,93], and the stable emf of the concentration-
cell cannot be established in this case, hence
DEPdH
x
,E changes at random. In experiments, stirring
the solution around the electrode will enhance the mass
transfer in the electrolyte and minimize the effect of
bubbles. However, the usual method for enhancing the
mass transfer, such as the rotating disc electrode, cannot
be used because its technique requirements contradict
those of the ISRM.

3.7. Concentration-cell effect caused by the imperfect
configuration of the electrode:
In addition to the potential drops caused by the
applied currents as discussed in Sections 3.5 and 3.6,
another similar concentration-effect arises from the
imperfect configuration of the electrode. There may be
two cases: (1) a PdHx electrode acts as the anode and its
one or more leads exposed to the electrolyte as the
cathode form a concentration-cell; (2) one end of the
electrode exposed to the gas may behave as drainage for
preserving the fugacity of hydrogen in the electrode; the
hydrogen concentration in the electrode near the
electrolyte surface is then less than the average value
and the electrode itself forms a concentration-cell. All
these concentration differences may induce an emf:
Eq. (80) where Dx is the hydrogen concentration difference
between the PdHx electrode and its equilibrium value
for case (1), or the concentration difference exists in the
PdHx electrode itself in case (2). Similarly to Eqs. (64)
and (77), we obtain the additional potential drop:
Eq. (81) where SC is a shape factor of the order of 1 and its value
depends on the geometrical characteristics of the electrode
and its leads. The induced additional resistance is:
Eq. (82). The sign of RA,I depends on which lead(or leads) and its
(or their) area exposed to the electrolyte. Using the
parameters: Dx /0.3, ¯ x/ /0.7, IM /0.1 A, RPdH
x
/RC /
1, it is about 9/0.163 SCRPdH
x
, so it is important to
avoid these defects in experiments.

Combining Eqs. (42), (66), (78) and (82), we obtain
the apparent resistance in the ISRM during the electrolysis
process:
Eq. (83). From this equation, we find that four measurement
errors with different origins can be incorporated into a
more uniform expression. On the whole, two ratios, i.e.
IE/IM and RPdH
x
/RS have the most important influence
on the resistance measurement as was discussed above.

On the other hand, we can obtain the condition below
from Eq. (83) for a perfect electrode (RA,I /0):
Eq. (84) as a first approximation. The contributions of RA,S,
RA,M and RA,E cancel each other out, and the measured
resistance is exactly the actual value. This means one can
modify the measuring current during the electrolysis
process to minimize the error. Because RC depends on IE
according to Eq. (54), so Eq. (84) is not a strict linear
function as expected, but it provides a suggestion for
diminishing the measurement error in the ISRM.

The concentration-cell effect appears only in the
single phase PdHx electrode. In the mixed a /b phase,
the chemical potential of hydrogen does not change in
PdHx under the external potential drop [50,51]. The
apparent resistance is:
Eq. (85). Even in this case, the electrolysis current collection and
electrolyte co-conduction still make contributions to the
ISRM, so a low value of IE/IM is a necessary condition
in the dc method.

The results of Sections 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7 are mainly
theoretical and their qualitative aspects are consistent
with available experimental results [47 /52,54]. Their
quantitative verification needs to be carried out in future
experimental work.


4. Conclusions

In this paper, some problems on the resistance
method in determining the hydrogen content in PdHx
electrodes are discussed. First, the resistivity ratio, the
temperature coefficient of resistance and resistivity, and
the resistance of palladium subjected to hydriding /
dehydriding cycles are discussed. It is found that the
resistivity ratio is somewhat higher than the resistance
ratio for the same x value and its magnitude depends on
the self-stress state caused by hydrogen insertion. The
temperature coefficient increases with x when x /0.7
which was omitted in previous work. The Pd resistance
decreases with the number of hydriding /dehydriding
cycles. Second, the effect of the inhomogeneous distribution
of x in the electrode on determining the
hydrogen content is discussed theoretically. It is proved
that the errors are particularly significant when the Pd /
H system is in the mixed a /b phase or when the
resistance is near the maximum value. Finally, we
discuss the additional potential shift and hence the
apparent resistance of the PdHx electrode caused by
the co-conduction of the electrolyte, the concentrationcell
effect and collection of the electrolysis current and
imperfections of the electrode configuration in the
ISRM. The quantitative expression of these effects is
given and some of the theoretical predications are
consistent with available experimental results. Some
advice is given for measuring the resistance in experiments.
