    "abstract": "The Selective Resonant tunneling model is compared with Bethe?s early model for the solar energy calculation. They are similar in considering the resonance effect, the weak interaction, and the assumption for nuclear potential and the Coulomb barrier in order to obtain the correct result for the energy density in the sun. However, the selectivity of resonant tunneling is new in the present selective resonant model.",

        "In 2000, Dr. Roberto Andreani made a speech on closing session of the ICCF-8 (Lerice, Italy) that fusion energy is not necessary accompanied with the neutron radiation. He said that the solar energy was originated from proton-proton fusion, but there was no neutron accompanied. R. Andreani was the deputy director of the hot fusion project in ENEA (Frascati), Italy. He was leaving for Garching, Germany to work as the deputy director of the European team for ITER project. However, he paid attention to the cold fusion project from the beginning, and he did not refuse the cold fusion. Radiation-less fusion energy is a strong point of “cold fusion”. There was no reason to discredit the “cold fusion” just based on lack of neutron radiation. Selective resonant tunneling model was proposed in 1995 to explain why the fusion reaction should not be accompanied with neutron radiation. It is interesting to investigate how Bethe obtained his solar energy density in 1938, which was one of his merits to win the Nobel Prize later in 1967[1]",
        "2.2 Weak Interaction  Bethe clearly stated that weak interaction played key role for the fusion reactions in the sun. Four protons would be eventually combined together to form an alpha-particle and emit two positrons. The energy released is 26.8 MeV. Although a chain of reactions might be involved in the whole process, the first reaction was the formation of deuterons by proton combination, i.e. p + p →d + e+ + νe  The Fermi constantfor this weak interaction was a very small number g: g=0.9×10-4 sec-1, hence, the perturbation theory was applied to calculate the transition probability from the 2 protons to the ground state of deuteron. The cross section for the combination of two protons of relative velocity v was given by σ = ψ ψ dτ v g f W p d^2 Here, f(W)=0.132(the Coulomb correction factor in weak interaction), and )( )2(4 )2021 2 32 22 2− + +Λ + Λ + Λ = ∫. Here, b=4.37×10-13 cm is about the radius of the deuteron, x0=r0/b. Λ1 is the integration inside the nuclear well; both Λ2 and Λ3 are the integration outside the nuclear well. Λ2 is the integration which involver Φ; Λ3 is the integration which involves Θ. Hence, Λ3 represents the resonance effect. Based on the Table I in Bethe’s paper[1], we calculated the contribution from Λ3 which is more than 50% for his sets of parameters.(see Table I below).",
        "In the selective resonant tunneling model, an imaginary potential for nuclear well was introduced to make the phase shift complex such that[3]  ] 1 4 Im[{Re[ ]} {Im[ ] 1}4 Im[ ]C krC krCot Cot kCotk + −−= + −− =λ λπ λδ δπ δσ.

        "From Bethe’s early work[1] we may conclude that: (1) Resonance effect is necessary to obtain the correct number for the energy density in the sun; (2) Weak interaction gives correct order of magnitude for fusion reaction in the sun, although it is very weak; (3) Resonant tunneling effect in Bethe’s calculation was not complete.",
