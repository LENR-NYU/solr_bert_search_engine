    "abstract": "Based on the self-stress theory for hydrogen in thin tubular shells, we numerically calculate apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) of hydrogen in membranes obtained from the time-lag and half-rise methods under chemopotential- and flux-step boundary conditions. It is found that ADCs differ from the diffusion coefficient under stress-free conditions when either the initial concentration or the chemopotential-step (or flux-step) is taken to be a nonzero value. At the same time, effects of other parameters on values of ADC are discussed as well. The theoretical results are qualitatively consistent with the available experimental data. Our results indicate that a small current will give the minimum error in determining the diffusion coefficient while the initial hydrogen content is nonzero.",

        "In earlier works, we presented models describing self-stresses and related e'ects produced by hydrogen interstitials in thin shells and circular plates [9–11]. The UHD phenomena, the time courses of pressure change in a tube during hydrogen absorption and interruption of steady di'usion [1,2,13–24] were demonstrated and interpreted by these theories. Besides these phenomena, it has been found that self-stresses lead to changes of apparent di'usion coe6cient (ADC) if traditional relations are applied in experiments [1,2,13–26]. This is one of the reasons that ADCs of H in metal (alloy) hydrides di'er from one work to another. Because self-stresses are produced by the nonhomogeneous concentration distribution of hydrogen in metals and this is a necessary condition for di'usivity measurement, so self-stresses must a'ect di'usion processes, hence the di'usivity measurements. Therefore, it is important to diminish or subtract this e'ect in experiments. On the other hand, effects of self-stress on the transport of hydrogen in metals (alloys) are an important problem in corrosion kinetics, hydrogen storage and other related problems. All these issues form the academic and technological backgrounds of the present subject; we will discuss it using numerical methods based on the model established earlier [9–11].",
        "In this work, we give only the numerical results based on Eqs. (15)–(19) and using the frame reported earlier [33]. In the calculation, the time step is 10−6 and the space step is 10−2, and the precision is 10−4. The time-lag under the concentration-step condition is 0.16664 which gives a relative error of 1:6 × 10−4 in comparison with the standard value of 1/6. In the determination of  L and  1=2,   = 3 is long enough to make the 9ux approach the steady value.",
        "Another similar characteristic for both boundary conditions is that DL=D0¿1 and D1=2=D0¿1 when the applied QnH (or j0) is large but nH;0 is very small, which means that measurements of di'usion coe6cient must be taken with caution even for dilute solid solutions.",
        "On the other hand, the present theory is aimed at the situation of tube conPgurations. For the circular plates used widely in experiments [32,36–41], we have proved that this model is appropriate as a primary approximation [10]; the detailed discussion on this conPguration will be presented in the future. For other conPgurations, e.g. spheres, cylinders and plates, self-stresses must be treated separately according to the speciPc situations.",
        "In this paper, we numerically calculate ADCs of hydrogen in thin tubular membranes determined by the time-lag and half-rise methods under chemopotential- and 9ux-step boundary conditions to simulate di'usivity measurements of hydrogen in experiments based on the self-stress theory for interstitial solutions in thin tubular shells established earlier [9]. It is found that ADCs di'er from the SFDC when either the initial concentration or the chemopotential (or 9ux) step is large. Generally, ADCs are less than the SFDC under the chemopotential-step, i.e. the pressure-step for gas absorption or potentiostatic charging for electrochemical absorption. However, ADCs are greater than the SFDC under the 9ux-step, i.e. the galvanostatic charging. At the same time, we Pnd that the self-stress e'ects are proportional to the partial molar volume of hydrogen in metals but inversely proportional to temperature. Our results indicate that ADCs approach the SFDC only if the initial concentration and concentration-step (or 9ux-step) are small enough or the temperature is high enough. In measurements of di'usion coe6cient with nonzero hydrogen concentration (nH  = 0), the e'ective technique is using the galvanostatic charging with small current. Finally, our theoretical results are consistent with the available experimental data.",
