        "Until now, it has not observed definitively a phenomenon of electron captured by a deuteron to be dineutron in experiments. However, The two–neutron (“n–n coincidence measurements”) radioactivity was first observed from beta–delayed particle emission measuring by Azuma et al. in 1979. We guess there may be a possibility of electron captured by deuteron according to our results. It was often found a voltage drop accompanying always “anomalous heat” to come out during our experimental of the electrolysis of D2O before. May these voltage drops show such phenomena of electron capture? We did some investigation in this field. On the other hand, Yang also reported similar results before.",

        "The half–life of such electron capture decay is about 1.04 × 1011y, which is almost as the same as t1/2 =1.28× 109 year of K 40, the t1/2 =1.3 × 10 13 year of Te 123 and t1/2 =1.4 × 10 17 year of V 50 shown in that “CARDS”. The mass defect of this process is 6.694207691 × 10−5u. The mass of dineutron, or “neutro-deuteron” 20 X2 here is 2.01403513 u.",
