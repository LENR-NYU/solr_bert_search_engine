The conversion of mechanical energy to heat was neglected in studying the phenomenon. Considerable strain energy is stored in metals when processed from the ore. The initiation, growth, and propagation of cracks in the bulk disturb the energy balance within the metal. Deuterium induces and propagates cracks in metals and alloys, including palladium. The sudden discharge of fracture energy during crack propagation generates considerable heat. The abundance of deuterium in cracked palladium will not continue the heat-generation process. The confident figures-of-merit of cold fusion have been based on the small energy input to the electrolytic cells and do not consider the substantial energy required to process (by melting) the palladium from the ore, or to recycle the cracked electrode samples. In this paper, the work-of-fracture is shown to be the likely mechanism responsible for the excess heat in cold fusion.","critique lattice stress, stored energy fractofusion",Cold fusion - the heat mechanism.pdf,,,

This question is normally asked in the context of the statement that Quantum Mechanics shows that this phenomenon is impossible (a view that we share). Our answer is always based on the statement 'but what about the modelling of such systems in terms of QED?' which is always met by the insistence that Quantum Mechanics shows that Cold Fusion is impossible. We conclude that scientists do not understand QED or, if they have some understanding of this subject, then this must be subject to some major misconceptions. This pointless dialogue (perhaps more correctly described as two monologues conducted in parallel) and the insistence on the primacy of Quantum Mechanics in the modelling of systems in the Natural Sciences is unfortunate because it obscures the outcome of the investigations in the more normal fields of the Natural Sciences (more normal than Cold Fusion). A brief outline of the work which has led to the formulation of the concept of coherence will therefore be given under the aegis of the revolutions in our understanding of the Natural Sciences which has taken place since the latter part of the 19. Century. The main illustration of the way we can demonstrate the applicability of these concepts will be based on the study of nucleation and phase growth. The development of micro-electrode substrates allows us to study the statistics of the formation of the first nucleus; it will be shown that these statistics are strictly in line with concepts developed from QED coherence. We conclude that QED coherence is not just a concept to be confined to sub-atomic physics, cosmology etc. but that it pervades the modelling of the whole of the Natural Sciences including that of 'Cold Fusion'. Some of the major steps which have taken place in the development of this subject area will be illustrated",theory,"Concerning the Modeling of Systems in Terms of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED): The Special Case of ""Cold Fusion"".pdf",,,

Sci.,25,http://lenr-canr.org/acrobat/BiberianJPjcondensedx.pdf#page=74,2018-09-03,"In this paper we show that the helium-like hydrogen spectra obtained by Randell L. Mills  and ultra-dense hydrogen obtained by Holmlid  can be interpreted as experimental evidence of Binuclear Atoms. The hydrogen Binuclear Atom, a model proposed 25 years ago, is a metastable configuration in which the two nuclei are held together at a very short distance in an atom-like configuration. This should be a distinctive configuration of the hydrogen molecule where nuclei are characterized by a high kinetic energy, and nuclear motion is coupled with electronic motion. This is a completely different model from the usual Born-Oppenheimer picture of atoms and molecules we are used to, where nuclei oscillate about their equilibrium positions and electronic motion is decoupled from the nuclear one. The identification of helium-like hydrogen spectra and ultra-dense hydrogen as Binuclear Atoms has a strong impact on one of the main objections to Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR): the overcoming of the Coulomb barrier thus identifying a sound mechanism for the occurrence of LENR.  This work is not  conclusive. The only goal of this work is to focus the attention of people interested in LENR mechanism on this subject, and encourage them to take this hypothesis more seriously.","Binuclear atom, LENR, Mills hydrino, Rossi E-Cat, Ultra dense hydrogen",12_BiberianJPjcondensedx.pdf,,74.0,81.0

Surface segregation was observed in samples that were essentially α-phase materials,i.e., high-purity commercial α-Ti, Ti-6A1, and Ti-3A1-2.5V, whereas Ti-6A1-4V had slight enrichment and β-Ti-13Mn had no detectable segregation. Nuclear reaction analysis (NRA) techniques were used to measure the near-surface deuterium concentration, and the segregation has been localized to within 50 nm of the surface. The time-dependent increase of deuterium at the surface is consistent with deuterium diffusion from the bulk to the surface and a room-temperature diffusivity of approximately 3 × 10-9 cm2/s. Surface enrichment in excess of 30 times the bulk concentration was observed in charged samples and in excess of 60 times for samples that had been charged and then vacuum annealed. Polishing was found to be of importance in causing segregation. The presence of deuterides or a surface defect state is suggested to explain the deuterium surface enrichment.","TiD, transmutation, D2, Ti",Deuterium surface segregation in titanium alloys.pdf,,,

More than three hundred LENR papers from 1989 to 2008 that reported excess energy were acquired and reviewed to extract quantitative results and other information. Excess energies and cell volumes were found in 17 papers. These data were used to compute eV per water molecule values. Most experiments showed excess energy outputs that would lead to ratios below the vibrational energy of water molecules at room temperature (0.04 eV/molecule). However, 65% of the papers, which reported both excess energies and cell volumes, indicated values significantly higher. The highest  reported value was 42.6 eV/molecule. Eleven ratios are far beyond what is plausible for water to be the source of anomalous heat. Therefore, it is concluded that some unknown rearrangement of water molecules in many LENR experiments is not the source of excess heat.",,41_ViolanteVproceeding.pdf,,109.0,115.0

In fact, most of the experiments and deductions of material sciences are based on the assumption that space?time is flat and isotropic (Minkowskian). After discarding this assumption, a theory of Deformed Space Time (DST) was developed in the last decades. Following this theory, experimental results were obtained which are not predicted by the Standard Model. The DST-theory concerns the fundamental interactions and in particular the nuclear ones, that can play the main role in the observed anomalies. In order to consider a nuclear reaction as a DST-reaction, four main phenomenological features were deduced: occurrence of an energy threshold; change of atomic weight; absence of gamma radiation; anisotropic emission of nuclear particles in intense beams having a very short life span. From the experimental point of view, rather than looking for fortuitous events that produce the conditions for DST-reactions, more systematic research can be undertaken by following the above reported four general rules. In particular, the occurrence of thresholds can correspond to a latency time, required to reach the energy density necessary to deform space?time. The absence of gamma radiation cannot be considered as a sign that nuclear reactions are not present; in fact, in absence of detected gamma radiation, elements were found which were not present before the reaction. The nuclear emissions, which are anisotropic and impulsive, can be difficult to detect with the traditional methods, thus inducing incertitude on the occurring reactions. Finally, a rapid variation of energy density is an experimental common factor of DST-reactions. Thus, the DST-theory can be the leading theory in the design of the experiment and in the interpretation of its experimental results.","Deformed space?time theory (DST-theory), DST reactions, Gamma emissions, Hydrogen/deuterium loading, Local, Lorentz invariance breakdown, Low energy nuclear reactions, Neutron emission, Ultrasounds",47_BiberianJPjcondensedzc.pdf,,41.0,48.0

Upon commissioning of one unit, the hydraulic transient in the draft tube during load rejection above 75% was excessive. It was apparent that the guide vane closing law that had been adopted would result in water column separation during load rejection at full power. Tests with a slower closing rate showed that the risk of column separation was reduced, but a violent surge developed in the draft tube close to maximum over speed. The energy level and cavity volume that are produced are much more than those of regular TCB (Transient Cavitation Bubbles) experiments, and therefore, we should expect more intense effects than a regular TCB jet produces.","cavitation, ultrasonic, heat",65_AminiFproduction.pdf,,,

A very specific process involving intense charging and discharging of deuterium from the palladium cathode during continuous electrolysis of heavy water, called the “on-off effect,” was discovered. This effect is 10 to 100 times stronger than the ordinary on-off effect of the current. As the palladium absorbed and exhausted the deuterium, the thermal behavior of the palladium was examined in detail.

Thus, their experiments failed to discover the thermal characteristics of the palladium cathode, the on-off effect, and intense cold fusion.

This fusion reaction is thought to be sustained by localized “Latticequake” in a solid-state media with the deuterium density equivalent to that of the host solid. While exploring this basic proposition, the characteristic differences when compared with ultra high temperature-state plasma fusion (“Hot Fusion”) are clarified. In general, the most essential reaction product in both types of the deuterium plasma fusion is considered to be helium, irrespective of the “well-known and/or unknown reactions”, which is stored within the solid-state medium in abundance as a “Residual Product”, but which generally can not enter into nor be released from host-solid at a room temperature. Even measuring instruments with relatively poor sensitivity should be able to easily detect such residual helium. An absence of residual helium means that no nuclear fusion reaction has occurred, whereas its presence provides crucial evidence that nuclear fusion has, in fact, occurred in the solid.","Pd D2O, Helium, heat+, Pd-black","Achievement of solid-state plasma fusion (""cold fusion"").pdf",,,

In other word, there are two kinds of reaction, i.e., the energy release and product formation. The reaction should increase proportionally with increase in number of fusion reaction for long period. As a result, tremendous amount of reaction product, i.e., Helium, should be accumulated in the host solid as the frozen state in ordinary temperature. Therefore, the Pd host-solid was heated to high temperature in vacuum, and then a large amount of Helium released from solid was detected by mass spectroscopy. Namely, in the present experiment, the solid-state plasma fusion ('Cold Fusion') was verified by detection of tremendous Helium product as well as huge excess energy.

B,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/pjab1977/72/9/72_9_179/_article/-char/ja/,,"In a series of studies, a significantly large amount of helium (42He/D2_??_(1-0.2)×10-2 and 42He/32He_??_4, D2:“fuel”helium:“ash”) was clearly detected with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) as the deuterium nuclear reaction product (“ash”) released from the highly deuterated palladium host-solid (Pd-black distributed 0.02-0.06 [μ]: average 0.04 [μ]) that had produced large amounts of anomalous excess energy (200-500 [MJ/cm3]) through long period such as 5000 [hrs], when it was heated in a high vacuum (_??_10-8 [torr]), high temperature (_??_1000 [°C]). On the other hand, a simultaneous measurement by another QMS catched a signal of the existence of 32He, while it is considerably less existence than 42He. In comparable measurements from non-deuterated samples, any helium and deuterium were not detected. This means that there exist no well-known Rutherford type as a main reaction of the deuterium nuclear reaction within Pd host-solid, and an inherent feature of solid-state with much valency electron cloud such as Pd presents a circumstance for a new type of deuterium nuclear fusion reaction which directly produces 42He as main reaction product. Because the helium (42He, 32He) was observed only after each sample had been heated in a high vacuum, in each case, the laws of physics require that this helium could not have diffused from any outside source other than the Pd metal sample. Also because helium was observed only after the sample was heated to a relatively high temperature, in each case, it must have been trapped within an interior location of the sample. Because there is no known process that can account for the diffusion of the large amounts of helium into the interior locations of the various samples at the levels that were measured, the only possible explanation for the helium being trapped in this fashion is that it was trapped within each sample after it was first produced as the nuclear ash from an electrolytically induced (Cold Fusion) deuterium nuclear reaction. To understand these results, the authors have constructed a theory, based upon a coherent process that is believed to be induced in highly deuterated Pd black crystals. In this theory, it is postulated that Cold Fusion is initiated through the formation of a Strongly Coupled Plasma (“SC-Plasma”), reminiscient of the SC-plasma's that are found within stellar interiors. This postulate is consistent with the assumption that a deuterium nuclear reaction is initiated in a localized zone within a host solid, and it is indispensable that the deuterium be transformed coherently for at least a few picoseconds into a SC-plasma, which the authors refer to as a deuterium “coherent plasma” within the solid-state. It is also postulated that this “coherent solid-state plasma fusion” is initiated through a violent, localized vibration of the lattice, which the authors refer to as a “Latticequake”. This “Latticequake” is essentially accompanied with both of an intense electromagnetic turbulence and violently shaking electron cloud under a many body effect in coherent-state.","Theory, helium",Deuterium nuclear reaction process within solid.pdf,,,

However, since it is almost impossible for these helium atoms to then escape from the Pd-black host to the surrounding environment at ambient temperature, to confirm their presence it is absolutely essential that Pd-black samples be heated to high temperatures to expel whatever helium they may contain. Therefore, to confirm the existence of helium atoms generated from deuterium in samples of Pd-black, we simply employed the“Sample Heating”process (room temperature _??_1500°C), but carried it out using both a“QMS”system and a super-high vacuum favorable“Getter pump”inside a totally sealed vessel. We termed this methodology“closed QMS”, and developed a related discrimination method which applies an opportunely changing voltage to the anticipated elements present inside the“closed QMS”environment. Measurements were then taken as the applied voltage was both increased and decreased between 70_??_20[V] (here, range being determined by the ionization potential Vi[eV] for helium series elements). Using this principle, which we call the“Vi-effect”, in brief, we were able to conclusively confirm the presence of both 42He and 32He atoms, as well as their relative ratio. It is evident that development of both the“closed QMS”system and the“Vi-effect”methodology were vital to finally prove the presence of helium generated by deuterium nuclear fusion within highly deuterated Pd-black.","electrolysis, Helium D2O, H2O","Presence of helium (4/2He, 3/2He) confirmed in deuterated Pd-black by the ""vi-effect"" in a ""closed QMS"" environment.pdf",,,

Briefly, the lattice parmeter calculated from Bragg peaks obtained from diffraction by metal near the surface of the sheet opposite the charging surface increases at a rate that is extremely low in view of the known diffusivity of hydrogen in the metal. In addition, different Bragg reflections lead to different values of lattice parameters and to different time dependencies; also, grain rotation occurs. The suggested mechanism for these phenomena involves large amounts of plastic deformation caused by stress generation caused by hydrogen concentration gradients. We report here an additional phenomenon that occurs in thin metal films sputtered upon a much thicker metal substrata when the latter is cathodically charged with hydrogen.

Single crystal samples of Pd absorbed deuterium rather slowly, but nevertheless reached comparatively high 0.89 D/Pd loading ratio. Many fine slip band structures were observed on the surface, and several micro-cracks existed in the crystal of post electrolysis specimens. High purity (>99.99%) polycrystalline Pd samples with surface purification treatment such as annealing at 850-1000 C in ultrahigh vacuum, also showed high (0.91 in max.) loading characteristics. Thermal etching effects were observed on the surface of annealed specimens at higher temperatures and high vacuum conditions. Surface microcracks along the grain boundaries as well as blistering of the electrode surface were observed in some cases. Surface impurities analysis showed that Li atoms penetrate into the Pd cathode to a depth of several hundred to a thousand Angstroms from the surface.

Condensed Matter Nucl. Sci. 5 ( 2011 ) 7), in this paper, the authors have analyzed the state of the deuterium atom in a tetrahedron cage, using the first principle molecular orbital calculation. In the simulation analysis of the tetrahedron cage, it is indicated that the titanium pair causes the deuterium atom to have ligancy 2 in the cage with two hydrogen atoms. If neutron generation occurs, we can deduce from the past experimental results that it occurs after a small increase of kinetic energy of deuterium atoms. This suggests that the quantity of neutron generated may increase if we can give kinetic energy to the adsorbed deuterium atoms in the titanium crystal by another means other than a temperature rise, at a suitable temperature and pressure. The authors propose a new experimental apparatus which appears to promote and increase the neutron generation.","Deuterium, Neutron generation, Proposed apparatus, Tetrahedron cage, Titanium",171_BiberianJPjcondensedh.pdf,,6.0,14.0

Recent simulation analysis results, related to the predicted cluster or cell models of deuterium atoms adsorbed in titanium crystal, together with the related calculations by Coulomb formula and Yukawa formula were investigated. Coulomb force working between deuteron?deuteron (d?d) particles is compared with the nuclear force working between them. The change of the force to each of them is evaluated in accordance with the distance between them, near the surface of the atomic nucleus. Taking into account the results of previous studies, it seems that nuclear fusion will occur occasionally without adding any specified energy. We think that there is a possibility of a collision of free deuterons through the medium of a negative charge in a deuterium atom in ligancy 2. On the other hand, we think that if a suitable amount of energy, which is far smaller than that of high temperature nuclear fusion, such as the irradiation of the alternative electromagnetic wave, for example, is supplied to adsorbed deuterium atoms and desorbed deuterons in the titanium (Ti) shavings packed in the experimental cylinder under a pressurized or evacuation condition with a suitable temperature rise, then there also will be a higher probability of nuclear fusion being achieved.","Adsorption, Coulomb force, Desorption, Deuterium, Nuclear force, Titanium",172_BiberianJPjcondensedq.pdf,,29.0,40.0

The force of each of them was evaluated in accordance with the distance between them, near the surface of an atomic nucleus. As a result, it was found that there were two regions. One of them is the stronger Coulomb force region and the other is the stronger nuclear force region. At the boundary of these regions, both forces are equal to each other. It appears that if the adsorbed deuterium atom in ligancy 2 and the desorbed free deuteron are placed in a suitable magnetic field, both the electron in the adsorbed deuterium atom in ligancy 2 and the desorbed free deuteron are influenced by the magnetic lines of force. The author deemed that there might be an aperture of the energy barrier. If there is the aperture of such an energy barrier, there must be a possibility for two deuterium nuclei to collide and produce nuclear fusion without being under tremendous high temperatures. To confirm this possibility, the author has studied and evaluated the behavior of the charged particle and calculated the working force under the homogeneous and stable magnetic field. As an example, under this influence in the magnetic field, the working force, the behavior of a deuteron, a co-existing deuteron and an adsorbed deuterium atom in ligancy have been analyzed. However, the working force to the particle, the Lorentz force, is very small compared to the Coulomb force. The motion of the charged particle and the electron orbital plane in an adsorbed deuterium atom in ligancy 2 in the magnetic field is the preferable direction. To analyze the possibility of nuclear fusion at room temperature, it is thought that a more advantageous circumstance than that proposed in this paper should be prepared.","Coulomb force, Deuterium, Lorentz force, Magnetic field, Nuclear force",173_BiberianJPjcondensedz.pdf,,149.0,157.0

We also investigated the effect of pyridine, a permeation promoter on hydrogen absorption in palladium membranes. Electrochemical parameters of double layer capacitance, charge transfer resistance and surface roughness were characterized using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy for both treated and untreated cathodes.

Specifically it predicts that cold fusion is likely with Ni cathodes and electrolysis with either ordinary or heavy water, whereas it is likely only for heavy-water electrolysis with Pd cathodes. The question of whether or not this 1993 theory has any predictive power regarding the 2003 Letts-Cravens effect is considered and answered as: ""partially."" That is, the ""optimal"" range of wavelengths includes that discovered by Letts and Cravens, but because of the possibility of multi-photon reactions it does not uniquely single out their 680 nm as best, which would require a more detailed model (including e.g. cathode temperature) than provided by the simplified 1993 theory.",Theory,250_BassRWoptimallas.pdf,,,

How does one quantify this scientifically, when random process disturbances and random measurement noises preclude perfect linearity? This question is answered under the assumption of Gaussian (or ""normal"") departures from ideal linearity regarding t hetwo mentioned statistical aspects. This is a generalization of the protocol propose dby Bass [1], which is more realistically flexible in several respects.

This story, written for the college reader without scientific training, presents the abundant replication of excess heat results by many laboratories in several countries. Excess heat research, referred to as cold fusion research, is presently an empirical science known as low energy nuclear reactions (LENR).

This task required the production of a quantity of heat energy by a mass of material so small that the origin of the energy cannot be attributable to a chemical process.  The gas-phase form of AHE is difficult to reproduce and hence lacks a measure of credibility.  The goal is to enhance its credibility by reproducing results first demonstrated in Japan and later reproduced in the U.S. by a solitary investigator.  The technique heated nanometer-sized Ni:Pd particles (20:1 molar ratio) embedded in micron-sized particles of an inert refractory of ZrO2.

The necessary presence of deuterium suggests that fusion reactions can be partially or totally responsible for the generation of excess heat.Experience has shown neutron emission to be sporadic and very weak; on the other hand tritium was found in small but detectable amounts. Moreover if tritium accumulates in the solution it can be comfortably measured postmortem.Two experimental campaigns were performed:The first one in Frascati having as main objective the detection of tritium excess. Particular care was exerted to avoid any tritium and hydrogen contamination.The second one at the Texas A & M University in the framework of a scientific collaboration, having as objective the excess of heat and tritium measurement.","Pd, D2O, heat+, tritium-, neutron-, electrolysis, pulse loading, ICCF-2, negative",319_BertalotLanalysisof.pdf,,,

Furthermore, the correlation of HE with some features of the experiment seemed to be well established, the most convincing of which is the threshold of the D/Pd ratio. What is yet not quite clear is how to obtain a high D/Pd ratio, since this feature seems to depend both on the material and on the procedures adopted for the electrolysis. In this paper we will propose a novel approach to this problem, which permits us to correlate HE with other features of the experiment. In particular, we try to study the transport of matter across the palladium lattice during the electrolysis. A model proposed by two of us (ADN and VV), and presented at this Conference, helps to interpret the experimental results, and gives interesting hints for future research.","Pd, D2O, heat+., electrolysis, oneside electrolysis, ICCF-3, D2",320_IkegamiHthirdintera.pdf,,106.0,112.0

A proton conductor layer (poly-ethyleneoxide) (PEO) and phosphoric acid) is deposited between the cathode and the two anodes. The system is placed in a chamber filled with deuterium gas, at a temperature of 75?C. At first, deuterium fills the two anodes up to D/Pd = 0.48 measured by pressure decrease. Then a voltage is applied between cathode and anodes, and the cathode gets loaded by D+ electrochemical migration through the solid state electrolyte. Correspondingly, the pressure decreases. Loadings of up to 0.73 have been obtained. When voltages are reversed, the cathode deloads, and the pressure in the chamber increases. This method is well suited to measure over-potentials and absolute loadings. The input power is very low, since the production of D+ ions entering the cathode is close to 100% whereas in liquid electrolyte cells, a small fraction of the ions produced is absorbed by the cathode. Therefore excess heat measurement is easily detected.","Pd, D2, heat loading, ICCF-9",342_BiberianJPdeuteriumg.pdf,,,

Deuterium gas is introduced in the tube at various pressures, and temperatures and diffuses out through the walls of the tube. The tube, heated by a resistor, is positioned inside a reactor cell which is a small vacuum chamber. The reactor cell is positioned inside a second vacuum chamber. The outer walls of the vacuum chamber are water cooled. Thermal energy is determined by measuring inlet and outlet temperatures and water mass flow.

Tubes were heated at various temperatures and either filled with palladium powder or palladium compounds or empty. Our mass flow calorimeter enables us to accurately measure excess heat production. We usually used palladium tubes 10 cm long, 2 mm outer diameter with 200 ?m thick walls, and closed at one end. Deuterium gas is introduced in the tube at various pressures, and temperatures and diffuses out through the walls of the tube. Thermal energy is determined by measuring inlet and outlet temperatures of cooling water and its mass flow. The energy yield of this calorimeter is 95-98% depending on input power. Our best result so far is an excess heat of 3 W with an input power of 47 W using an oxidized palladium tube filled with palladium powder.

However, the scientific demonstration of cold fusion was made long ago by showing the evidence of excess heat production in electrolytic cells and other devices. Also, nuclear ashes have been observed, mainly the formation of helium-4 along with the production of excess heat. What makes this field difficult to accept is the lack of the usual particle emission observed in nuclear science or high-energy physics. In some instances low-level neutron production, X-ray emission and transmutation of elements have been measured. At this point there is no satisfactory theory explaining the unique characteristics of condensed matter nuclear science. Many models have been proposed, several of them using textbook physics.","cold fusion, condensed matter nuclear science, low-energy nuclear reaction, excess heat, transmutations",349_BiberianJPcondensedma.pdf,,,

The Dewar that contained the experiment shattered. It is unlikely that the explosion was due to a deuterium oxygen recombination explosive reaction, since the cell was open, the amount of deuterium and oxygen gas was very limited in the cell and any pressure created by recombination should have escaped through the unsealed open end of the cell. It is very likely that under some not yet understood conditions, chain reactions occur in highly loaded palladium samples giving rise to an explosion.

In the first part, Storms explains the difference between hot fusion and cold fusion. The mechanisms of hot fusion and cold fusion cannot be the same. For example, in fractofusion the mechanism is identical to hot fusion (it is not LENR), and the reaction products are the same as those of hot fusion. Cold fusion operates under a different mechanism. Storms assumes that hot fusion operates under the basic laws of thermodynamics which explain the data observed. On the other hand, cold fusion operates under the laws of statistics.

Production continued for ~ 750 hours after which time it was arbitrarily curtailed. Production of T was found to cease every few days but could be resuscitated by increasing the overpotential of the electrode reaction. A logarithmic relation between the rate of tritium production and the overpotential of the electrode reaction was established. The Will-Cedzynska method of examining T contamination in specimens has shown that nothing above the background of T was detected if no D2O had been electrolytically evolved on the Pd specimens concerned. Helium production was found to accompany that of T. The He was analyzed by thermal expulsion and mass spectroscopy. No He3 was found but He4 was measured in nine specimens out of ten examined. Voids were also detected - 1 micron within the electrode. The excess tritium production on Pd co-deposited with deuterium was found. Cracking and spreading of cracks is shown.

It was also believed in March, 1989, that high energy neutrons were the path towards atomic fission, as in nuclear reactors; and that collisions of H isotopes at extremely high temperatures similar to those in the sun, constituted the main path towards the fusion of nuclei. . . .",history,463_BockrisJearlycontr.pdf,,,

However, published accounts on elemental change in solids have been around since before the discovery of the nucleus. Thus, the earliest evidence for creation of new elements was that reported for reactions in biological systems. In view of the wave of negative opinion against the 1989 and thereafter work, it is interesting to note a U.S. Army report of 1978 which concluded that the evidence for nuclear reactions in biology was strongly positive. Even less well-known is that U.S. government labs in the 1970s experimented with neutron emission arising from the passage of very high currents through wires, conditions under which thermonuclear reactions should not have been occurring.",transmutation,464_BockrisJistheoccur.pdf,,,

The Fleischmann and Pons announcement of March 1989 was of interest partly because of its radical nature, but also because I had known Martin Fleischmann since his days as a student at the Imperial College of Science and Technology in London.

At this value damage begins to be seen in the SEM photographs of the interior of the electrodes. Tritium formation became detectable at an overpotential (η) of about 0.4 V. The reaction occurs in two consecutive steps: the first is a Volmer-Tafel reaction which occurs when the overpotential is less than 0.3 V. But as the measured coverage θD approaches unity, the deuterons begin to discharge onto the adsorbed deuterium (Heyrovsky mechanism). The second (consecutive) step leads to the tritium formation via a neutron transfer from the electrode to the Pd-D bond which at this stage (near to full occupancy by D) is relatively weak. The ready availability of neutrons in the surface region of the metal catalyst is rationalized in terms of the high electron concentration associated with the surface and he presence of D arriving from D2O in the solution: e- + D+ = 2 neutrons + a neutrino. The model is applied to two anomalies which have troubled this reaction. One is irreproducibility and also the long time (100 h or more) before any nuclear activity is seen.","Deuterium, Mechanism, Neutron, Nuclear, Tritium",469_BiberianJPjcondensedf.pdf,,31.0,36.0

Sci.,11,http://lenr-canr.org/acrobat/BiberianJPjcondensedj.pdf#page=6,2013-04-23,"After receiving a Ph.D. Degree from Imperial College, Fleischmann (F) went to work in the University of Newcastle in the U.K. and spent productive years there (metal deposition, micro-electrodes, and electrochemical extraction from mixtures metals). His reputation grew at a time (1950-1960) when electrochemistry was a popular subject for university research. British Electricity saw their chance to get a star performer down to Southampton University as professor, so they paid for a chair for a person who could attract research support and found that F could fill the job, although it was open to other candidates. Fleischmann occupied the chair for only a few years, less than had been foreseen, and retired from university life some years before it is usual. By this time he already was a Fellow of the Royal Society and also a director of the Max Planck Institute in Berlin. Fleischmann made a colleague of Stanley Pons, head of the Chemistry Department in the University in Utah. Pons (P) was of independent means and could fund research which the two of them might think out together. Fusion means coming together and F saw in electrochemistry a high performance way whereby this might be done. What they found was that the heat evolved in a particular deuterium solution when they passed current through it was larger than it should have been according to known chemical theory. In addition to this they observed some neutrons. They suggested that the extra heat was due to an unknown nuclear reaction. What was unusual about the next step was that F&P got on the McNeil-Lehrer Hour and announced that they had been the first to carry out a nuclear reaction in the cold. After a short time, the nuclear chemists of the world turned against F&P and said that their claims must be all nonsense. The anti-Fleischmann opinion expressed at meetings was so great that they decided that it would be a good thing to escape to some other country. They had a friendship with a very wealthy man, Mr. Toyota, and he had already founded some laboratories in the South of France. He offered F and P laboratory space there and they could move their operation to it free of the negative atmosphere which reigned in America. At first the news which came from the laboratory in France was good. Alas, this was not maintained and after two years they split up and P retired to live in France whilst F retired to Tisbury in the U.K. But F?s creativity would not lie down and he was soon to apply something new, Quantum Electrodynamics. He made a colleagueship with a well-known Italian physicist Preparata. However, fate was not kind to F and he discovered that he was suffering from Parkinson?s disease. This is a slow disease but it?s incurable. However, for a couple of years F continued to attend meetings and make intelligent remarks at them. He died on 3 August 2012. Was F a brilliant theorist who did not have time to realize his true vision or had Jack the Flash, his nickname, flashed too much? The field that could have been his greatest is now called condensed matter nuclear reactions.","Fleischmann, Eagerness, Ideas, Imperial College, Quantum electrodynamics, Royal Society",472_BiberianJPjcondensedj.pdf,,6.0,12.0

Fleischmann, and S. Pons demonstrated an anomalous heat in 1989. There have been attempts to explain anomalous heat by deuteron?deuteron nuclear fusion in the Pd lattice while the search for radiation was unsuccessful which indicated that the origin of the excess heat is unknown. Despite the unknown origin of the excess heat, Pd system is in the core of the research for energy production. The excess heat has been demonstrated by using calorimeters that are well characterized. However, these measurements are not able to provide detailed information about a localized heat rather than a heat from a large area. A new method is demonstrated to investigate an excess heat from Pd electrode loaded with deuterium or hydrogen. It is capable of measuring a small amount of heat generated in a localized area with a sub-micrometer resolution by fluorescence imaging with temperature sensitive fluorescence dyes. Considering quantum yield, photostability, and thermal stability, rhodamine 6G (R6G) is selected for temperature sensor along with a polymer, Poly MethylSilsesquioxane (PMSSQ). The thermal quenching of fluorescence resulted in a decreased temperature over time with heat generation. We envisioned that this new method of the temperature measurement provided a novel diagnostic tool for localized excess heat which was not detectable by calorimetry due to intrinsic disability.","Anomalous heat, Fluorescence, Temperature sensor",474_BiberianJPjcondensedw.pdf,,37.0,43.0

This paper, Part II of this series, illustrates the ground state configurations of the atomic nuclei, showing the basic segments of how the protons and neutrons cluster together, and how these segments bond to form larger atomic nuclei. A pattern emerges for the ground state configurations due to the uniformity of the electromagnetic laws. Diagrams are shown for this basic pattern, for both stable and radioactive atomic nuclei. By incorporating the electromagnetic energies and forces into nuclear theory, this model has been able to achieve not only excellent predictions of binding energy, but the ability to answer many other questions regarding the various behaviors of atomic nuclei.","Electromagnetics, Nuclear Force, Quarks, Nuclear molecules, Clustering, Nuclear diagrams, Lowest energy state",495_BiberianJPjcondensedzi.pdf,,147.0,193.0

An atomic model of the metallic crystal would give a better overall understanding of the palladium-hydrogen system. Unfortunately, a computer simulation of the wave mechanical properties of palladium based on solving the three-dimensional Schrodinger equation is a major undertaking [3, 4J that is probably unnecessary for calculating many useful character istics of palladium. A simpler approach, based on a Thomas-Fermi model [5J for palladium, is proposed by the authors. This semiclassical model averages the effects of all the electrons within an atom to approximate the electric field distribution everywhere. Overlapping these distr ibutions approximates the electric fields within the palladium crystal. This model predicts a crystal that is a bit too stiff, but overall it gives reasonable results; it is also simple to use.

A critical issue in determining whether or not the cold fusion process exists is the quality of the evidence concerning the composition of the gaseous products. The low intensity of neutrons has prompted proposals of other fusion processes such as d + d → 4He + γ [3] and p + d → 3He [4,5]. Accord?ingly, we report the results of experiments designed to detect helium in the effluent gases from electrolysis reactions at palladium cathodes while rigorously excluding possible helium contamination from other sources. The calorimetric electrolysis experiments reported here were performed at China Lake, and the analyses designed to establish the composition of the effluent gases were performed in Austin.","electrolysis, He+, heat+, Pd, D2O, H2O, film radiation",573_BushBFheliumprod.pdf,,,

More over data from these laboratories indicate that excess heat events are accompanied by 4He production. Excess heat generation appears to depend on a number of factors: the quality ? nature ? of the cathode, chemical species present in the D2O / LiOD electrolyte, the conditions surrounding the electrolysis process ? current density, potential, time, and the previous history of the cathode.

The focus was on all elements for which NAA is appropriate and sensitive. Although it is known that electrolysis deposits impurity metals on cathodic surfaces from the electrolyte (lithium deuteroxide in this case), this occurs only at the external surface of the rod. The samples were cut diametrally to minimize the surface relative to the bulk or interior portion of the cathode. Large increases in iron and zinc of a factor of 56 and 12 respectively were observed in the active cathode relative to the virgin material. Smaller but significant increases were observed for chromium, cobalt, and cesium. In addition, the Pd-110/Pd-108 ratios were determined. Preliminarily, it appears that Pd-108 was depleted in the active cathode relative to Pd-110 as compared with that ratio in the virgin material.

In Part II preliminary evidence is presented for x-ray emission accompanying both the heavy and light water excess heat effects in the form of both characteristic x-rays and bremmstrahlung. These studies had the unsatisfactory feature of low signal-to-noise, but the satisfactory features of reasonable statistics and excellent correlation. An interesting feature was that x-ray emission decreased somewhat after a cell was switched off, but then spiked upward to decay exponentially to the background level over a period of days. This emission was apparently associated with the desorption of hydrogen from the cathode. With the cell turned off it was also possible to study xray emission accompanying the thermal desorption of hydrogen by changing the cell temperature and studying x-ray emission as a function of cathode surface temperature. When this effect of x-rays accompanying desorption was factored in, Bush's TRM Model appears to account for the correlation between x-ray emission and excess power.","heat+, H2O, Ni, x-ray, radiation, ICCF-3",588_IkegamiHthirdintera.pdf,,149.0,156.0

The model is of some interest in that it is the first model to fit excess power-vs-Ioading fraction data of McKubre et al. (SRI Intemational/EPRI) and, independently, that of Kunimatsu et al. (IMRA). Of special note is that the peak of the theoretical curve of tritium production versus loading fraction, which is related to that for neutrons by a branching ratio scaling factor, is found to be at a fractional DlPd loading of approximately 0.825, whlch is in go.od agreement with the empirical value of 0.83 announced at the ICCF-5 by Iwamura et al.(Mitsuoishi) for both tritlUm and neutrons. It is of interest then that this theoretical ECFM tritium production curve arises essentially from purely statistical mechanical considerations involving the deuteron occupation of the three-dimensional interstitial lattice, rather than arising from the details of a specific nuclear mechanism. The model shows why tritium is ordinarily not observed when excess heat is being observed. For the neutron-to-triton branching ratio a theoretical lower limit (r/R)^12 results (r is the protonic charge radius and R is the deuteronic charge radius.) yielding a value of 2 x 10^-9 in agreement with the empirical value of 2 x 10^-9 for the neutron-to-triton branching ratio.","theory, ICCF-5",597_PonsSproceedinga.pdf,,142.0,145.0

Power levels exceeding 200 watts over a 20 hour period have been observed, although this large thermal response was obtained in only 4 out of 16 experiment runs, each using a new Pd cathode and electrolyte solution. In most cases, thermal power began after loading the Pd films followed by temperature cycling of the cell from room temperature to near 60 ?C. However one run showed a large thermal output without electrolytic loading of the cathode, indicating the possibility of a catalyzed chemical reaction between the electrolyte, the Pd cathode and Pt anode, and the air cover over the cell. Indeed all power producing runs were accompanied by a precipitated formation oflithium carbonate, indicating a strong coupling of the reaction with CO2 in the air.","thin-film, Pd, heat+, Li2CO3, ICCF-7",613_ENECOtheseventh.pdf,,43.0,55.0

Sci.,19,http://lenr-canr.org/acrobat/BiberianJPjcondensedr.pdf#page=25,2016-12-19,"An attempt is made to build an LENR theory that does not contradict any basic principle of physics and gives a relatively simple explanation to the plethora of experimental results. A single unconventional assumption is made, namely that nuclei are kept together by a magnetic attraction mechanism, as proposed in the 1980s of the past century by Valerio Dallacasa and Norman Cook. This assumption contradicts a non-proven detail of the standard model, which instead attributes the nuclear force to a residual effect of the strong interaction. The theory is based also on a property of the electron which has been known for long, but has rarely been used: the Zitterbewegung (ZB). This property should allow the magnetic attraction mechanism that binds nucleons together, to manifest also between the electron and any isotope of hydrogen, leading to the formation of three neutral pseudo-particles (the component particles remain separate entities), collectively named here Hydronions (or Hyd). These pseudo-particles can then couple with other nuclei and lead to a fusion reaction ""inside"" the electron. The Coulomb barrier is not overcome kinetically, but through what could be interpreted as a range extension of the nuclear force itself, realized by the electron when some specific conditions are satisfied. The most important of these necessary conditions is that the electron has to ""orbit"" the hydrogen nucleus at a frequency of 2.055 x 1016Hz. This frequency corresponds to photons with an energy of about 85 eV or equivalently a wavelength of 14.6 nm in the Extreme Ultra Violet (EUV). So the large quanta of nuclear energy fractionate into EUV photons during the formation of the Hydronions and during the coupling of Hydronions to other nuclei. The formation of Hydronions requires the so called Nuclear Active Environment (NAE), which is what makes LENR so rare and difficult to reproduce. The numbers suggest that the NAE forms when an unshielded atomic core electron orbital that has an ""orbital frequency"" near to the coupling frequency is stricken by a naked Hydrogen Nucleus (HNu). This theory therefore implies that the NAE is not inside the metal matrix, but in its immediate neighbourhood. The best candidate atoms for a NAE are listed, based on the energy of their ionization energies. The coincidence with the most common LENR materials appears noteworthy. The Electron Mediated Nuclear Reactions (EMNR) theory can explain also very rapid runaway conditions, radio emissions, biological NAE, and the so called ""strange radiation"".","EMNR theory, Extreme ultra violet, Hydronion, Magnetic attraction, Strange radiation, Zitterbewegung",614_BiberianJPjcondensedr.pdf,,25.0,36.0

According to this new model, the entire hydrogen permeation process is divided into several elementary steps: multicomponent mass transport in the feed and permeate side, adsorption and desorption on/from the membrane surface, absorption and de-absorption into/from the metal lattice, diffusion through the Pd-based bulk and multicomponent mass transport through an asymmetric multilayered porous support. Each of these steps is modeled by means of some equations whose solution provides as result the value of transmembrane flux and the hydrogen partial pressure profile through the membrane. The influence of each step is evaluated as a function of several operating conditions (membrane thickness, temperature, fluid-dynamic conditions, hydrogen partial pressure on feed and permeate side). The effect of the mass transfer in the feed and permeate side is evaluated in terms of concentration polarization effect by defining an opportune coefficient and analyzing its behaviour in different conditions. As results, the investigation shows that the influence of the polarization can be appreciable even for not so thin membranes and provides some ""polarization maps"", which are diagrams where the polarization level (in terms of CPC) can be directly visualized and simply estimated once knowing the external operating conditions. Hence, these maps can be very useful in order to predict better the membrane performances and, consequently, reduce the uncertainness during the design step of the membrane modules.",,632_ViolanteVproceeding.pdf,,198.0,201.0

The simulations indicate that small and middle-sized nuclei can be fractured along weakly bound planes of the lattice structure. It is argued that the simulations provide theoretical support for the experimentally-observed reactions and, moreover, that the probabilities calculated for various low-energy fissions can be used to explain the stepwise changes in the element abundances of the Earth?s crust, evolved from basaltic to sialic composition over geological time.","Earth crust composition, Lattice model, Nuclear cold fusion, Piezonuclear fission reactions",639_BiberianJPjcondensedn.pdf,,156.0,168.0

Despite the great amount of experimental results coming from the so-called Cold Nuclear Fusion and Low Energy Nuclear Reactions research activities, the comprehension of these phenomena still remains unanswered. On the other hand, as reported by most of the articles devoted to Cold Nuclear Fusion, one of the principal features is the appearance of micro-cracks on the electrode surfaces after the experiments. In the present paper, a mechanical explanation is proposed considering a new kind of nuclear reactions, the piezonuclear  fissions, which are a consequence of hydrogen embrittlement of the electrodes during electrolysis. The experimental activity was conducted using a Ni?Fe anode and a Co?Cr cathode immersed in a potassium carbonate solution. Emissions of neutrons and alpha particles were measured during the experiments and the electrode compositions were analyzed both before and after the electrolysis, recognizing the effects of piezonuclear fissions occurring in the host lattices. The symmetrical fission of Ni appears to be the main and most evident feature. Such reaction would produce two Si atoms or two Mg atoms with additional fragments as alpha particles.","Cold nuclear fusion, Electrolysis, Hydrogen embrittlement, Piezonuclear fissions",640_BiberianJPjcondensedn.pdf,,169.0,189.0

Loading results of Hydrogen were excellent (H/Pd1). The evidence of a new phase in the Pd-H system was inferred from the basis of the variation of the thermal resistivity coefficient of the Pd wire as a function of the H/Pd ratio. . . .","loading, Pd, bacteria, heat, H2O, D2O, ICCF-8",693_CelaniFhighhydrog.pdf,,,

The ICP-MS analyses of the insoluble powder were motivated from the recent results of Y. Iwamura and collaborators at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries-Research Center (Yokohama, Japan) showing reproducible ""transmutation"" of Sr into Mo (isotopic composition different from natural one) and Cs into Pr, when a special multilayer Pd sheet was subjected to a prolonged Deuterium gas flowing. Some of our results look partially in agreement with Y. Iwamura report. Other unexpected elements were also detected with an isotopic distribution close to the natural one. The production of stable isotopes by Selective Channel Photofission, according to the model of A.Takahashi (Osaka University, Japan), can help for? nderstanding.

This approach suggests a particular \emph{Zitterbewegung}  (ZBW) model for charged elementary particles.","Coulomb gauge,  Clifford algebra, Electric charge, Electron structure, Elementary particles,  Maxwell's equations, Lorenz gauge, Occam's razor, Space--time algebra, Vector potential, Zitterbewegung",716_BiberianJPjcondensedx.pdf,,106.0,134.0

To further improve the intrinsic, excellent catalytic proprieties of Cst in H2 ?2H dissociation, we subjected the surface to repeated cycling of ""flash"" oxidation (pulsed power up to 20 kVA/g), obtaining sub-micrometric particles of mixed composition (Cst?NiOx?CuOy?CuxNiyOz) and reducing deleterious self-sintering problems with nano-materials at high temperatures. Despite the fact that results with thin, long wires (F = 200 ?m, l = 100 cm) were generally positive and excess power (10?20%) was frequently recorded (5?10 W at 50 W input), reproducibility remained unsatisfactory. Later, we realized that iron impurities (up to 1% in the old, pre-1970 batch of Cst) enhanced AHE generation, especially atT > 500?C. Since 2014, we added Fe(NO3)3 solutions both to the Cst sub-micrometric surfaces (during flash oxidation process),and to borosilicate glass sheaths (SIGI-Fabier; micrometric fibers, previously wetted-dried with Sr(NO3)2 solution) where wires were inserted (as electrical insulation).

The oxidation of the wires by pulses of electrical current in air creates a rough surface featuring a sub-micrometric texture that proves particularly effective at inducing thermal anomalies when temperature exceeds 400?C. This effect appears also to be increased substantially by deposing segments of the wire with a series of elements (such as Fe, Sr, Mn, K, via thermal decomposition of their nitrates applied from a water solution). Furthermore, an increase of AHE was observed after placing the treated wires inside a sheath made of borosilicate glass (B?Si?Ca; BSC), and even more after impregnating the sheath with the same elements used to coat the wires. . . .","Air-flow calorimetry, Anomalous Heat Excess (AHE), Electro-migration phenomena, H2 --> 2H dissociation by Constantan, H2 and/or D2 absorption at high temperatures into Constantan, Low work function materials, Noble gases, Plasma surface interaction, Spont",720_BiberianJPjcondensedzc.pdf,,30.0,40.0

It reports on the experimental study of LENR phenomena in Constantan (Cu55Ni44Mn1) from its inception in 2011 to the most recent experiments. Using an empirical approach we identified the effect of surface modification of the Constantan wires with coatings comprised of elements that enhance the absorption behavior, and oxides with low work function for electron emission. We also explored certain geometrical arrangements of the wires such as knots and coils in order to induce local thermal gradients and predictable hot-spots. Moreover, the DC polarization of the wires by a counter-electrode proved to be a versatile approach to induce non-equilibrium conditions that are essential for Anomalous Heat Effects (AHE), especially when a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) is produced. From the review of experiments summarized in this article, we obtain indications that the main parameter controlling the AHE is the flux of reactive species through the surface of the loaded material. As a consequence, all other external conditions of the reactor core (voltage?current, temperature, pressure, electric field stimulations, DC and/or AC external fields), can be seen as co-factors that enable a flux of active species through surfaces and in the bulk of the materials. Although most of the tests are in agreement with a possible flux model, some results still lack an interpretation, probably due to limits of the experimental setup.","Anomalous Heat Excess (AHE), Cu?Ni?Mn alloy, Deuterium, Dielectric barrier discharges (DBD), Hydrogen, Low work function coatings, Nickel?Copper alloys, Nickel hydrides and deuterides",721_BiberianJPjcondensedzf.pdf,,52.0,79.0

Upon the suggestion of the Conference Organizers, we added a detailed explanation of our procedures; moreover, we included the latest results and data from our recently published papers. In the framework of LENR-AHE (Low Energy Nuclear Reaction - Anomalous Heat Effects) studies, since 2021, we have been focused on innovative, low-cost materials instead of the usual, precious metal palladium. We found that the Cu-Ni alloy, known as Constantan (also used for J-type thermocouple construction), has the peculiarity of being able to easily dissociate H2 (or D2) from molecularto an atomic state. While the catalytic feature appears at a rather low temperature (150 ?C), Constantan is also able to store atomic hydrogen within its lattice and/or at surfaces, up to temperature of 700-800 ?C, and in a wide range of pressures. Thanks to our long experience (since 1994) with wires, we designed various experiments that take advantage of such specific shapes, namely in terms of electromigration of absorbed and adsorbed H, under a suitable longitudinal electric field (0.4-2.5 V/cm), DC and/or pulsed. In 1995 we got noticeable results using Pd wires in electrolytic environments (D2O) at mild temperatures (40-60 ?C). Later on, in some experiments, we used even gaseous environments at high temperatures (up to 700-800 ?C). . . .","H2-induced LENR-AHE, H2 electromigration, High power electric pulses, Hydrogen flux, Memory effect",723_BiberianJPjcondensedzi.pdf,,418.0,445.0

To prevent and check the absence of the well-known artifacts that may affect this technique, we also perform measurements in gases featuring different thermal conductivity (such as Argon and Helium) or at low pressure (where the thermal conductivity of the gas phase reaches its minimum). After the calibrations, and accuracy testing with Helium, Argon, or vacuum, we discuss the outcome of experiments where the constantan wires are heated with alternating currents (AC) of different waveform or shape.

We found the results previously published to be consistent with our observations; namely we measured higher temperatures for the same input power when hydrogen is absorbed during a heating cycle. Nevertheless this temperature rise does not appear to correspond to an increase in heat production. We have added a temperature sensor to the container of the experiment. The temperature of the container follows the same temperature with input power curve irrespective of whether there is an anomalous absorption of hydrogen or not; therefore we have no evidence that this temperature increase corresponds to another source of heat. In conclusion, we have observed all the effects discovered by Focardi et al., but our results imply that there is no production of power associated with the absorption of hydrogen by nickel","Ni, H2, heat",732_CerronZebainvestigat.pdf,,,

Coulometric measurements during both the hydrogen deposition and subsequent removal steps have shown that H:Pd ratios of 0.7 are reached under these conditions, in accord with accepted values for bulk samples. The frequency decrease observed at AT-cut crystals during hydrogen (deuterium) loading is larger than that expected for the mass of hydrogen deposited into the film. Considering that palladium undergoes a substantial increase in volume upon hydrogen uptake, the role of the resulting film stress in influencing the observed frequency must be addressed. It has been found that such film stresses at an AT-cut crystal produce frequency decreases and that these effects can be accounted for using techniques which are well established in the frequency control field. Measurements at BT-cut crystals, the stress/frequency response of which is opposite to that of AT-cut crystals, have confirmed that stress plays a major role in the present work and have allowed the determination of a quantitative value for this stress. Investigations of mixtures of H2O and D20 have also been carried out and shed some light on the effect of small amounts of H2O in determining the H/D content in the palladium.","heat+, Pd, D2O, electrolysis, ICCF-1",759_NCFIthefirstan.pdf,,76.0,100.0

The vast  experimental data worldwide show a low neutrontritium ratio of 10^-8 to 10^-4 , far below the equal branching ratio, having been explained in this paper by a secondary nuclear process by the author. According to this secondary nuclear process, the generated neutrons and protons inside the solid has the chance to recombine into deuterium atoms for heavy water systems. In this sense the Huizenga's second and third miracles, the branching ratio miracle and the no nuclear products miracle, are therefore equivalent.

The neutral D atoms in the warm atomic plasma then fuse with the D atoms in the lattice via direct scattering, without going through the doorway step of forming D2 molecules. As a rough estimate for the fusion reaction rate, the velocity distribution of the thermalized D atoms is taken to be Maxwell-Boltzmann, leading to results in qualitative agreement with the experimental observations for a cluster of about 100 - 300 molecules.","theory, cluster, ICCF-1",779_NCFIthefirstan.pdf,,354.0,362.0

We will discuss that there are some aspects of classical electromagnetic theories which may have impact on our understanding on LENR/CMNS phenomena, including: (a) nonlinear electrostatic potential as proposed by Eugen Andreev, (b) vortex sound theory of Tsutomu Kambe, (c) nonlinear ponderomotive force, and (d) submicroscopic consideration.","Classical electromagnetic theory, Coulomb barrier suppression, Electronuclear potential, Nuclear Van der Waals force, Ponderomotive force, Subdeuterium, Submicroscopic physics, Vortex sound theory",810_BiberianJPjcondensedu.pdf,,32.0,39.0

The resulting nuclear interaction proceeds in a manner that approximately preserves either the initial periodicity of the lattice or the periodicity of a commensurate lattice. Reaction reversibility over timescales associated with electrostatic interaction results in condensed matter fusion being dominated by interactions in which both the products and reactants obey Bose-Einstein statistics. As a result tritium release and 3He+ production should not appear as primary fusion products.,theory,818_ChubbSRdistribute.pdf,,,

Our application of these mainstream ideas is inconsistent with the predominant paradigm that is commonly applied to Cold Fusion because it uses important ideas that relate periodic order to coherence that are known to apply at low temperature (LT) in solids and to hydrogen-in-metal systems that are not consistent with the conventional high temperature (HT) models that have formed the basis of conventional thinking. Implicit in this alternative (LT) picture is the important result that symmetry provides a means of ""hiding"" the potential location of a particular nuclear reaction.

High temperature plasma's (HTP's) are disordered. Because of this fact, collisions i n solids and HTP' s are very different. Specifically, because solids have periodic order, they can coherently absorb momentum, all at once at a point, discontinuously, and through recoil processes in which the solid, as a whole, moves in response to a collision at an isolated location. As a result, in ordered solids, very often, the initial momentum of ""colliding"" particles is not conserved by the particles during ""collisions. "" At lowlintermediate temperatures, these kinds of ""collisions"" play a dominant role i n the following important effects: 1 . the conduction of heat and electricity (Ashkroft and Mermin, 1 976A), 2. diffraction of neutrons, electrons and X-rays (Ashkroft and Mermin, 1 976B), and 3 . the Mossbauer effect (Schwinger, 1990; Schwinger, 1 994). Because the idealized limit of stoichiometric PdD is periodically ordered, not only is there reason to believe that further D-loading will result in the occupation of ion band states by D-nuclei. it is probable that the potential nuclear reactions and transport of ion band state D (Chubb and Chubb, 1 991) will be dominated by these kinds of interactions. . . .",theory,827_ENECOtheseventh.pdf,,73.0,77.0

Thus, counter-intuitive ideas about local and non-local effects can become dominant.? In particular, in PdH or PdD, provided external forces are applied uniformly, it is entirely possible for hydrogen (p) or deuterium (d) nuclei to acquire a common phase (a broken gauge symmetry1) and to ""become wave-like"" and interact coherently, through the electromagnetic field, simultaneously, but an-isotropically at the boundaries of a PdD or PdH substrate, or at isolated locations within either substrate.?

In the paper, standard many-body physics techniques are used to illustrate this fact.? Specifically, the paper shows that formally the theories by Schwinger, Hagelstein, and Chubb and Chubb (C&C), all can be related to a common set of equations, associated with reaction rate and energy transfer, through a standard many-body physics procedure (R-Matrix theory).? In each case, particular forms of coherence are used that implicitly provide a mechanism for understanding how LENR?s can proceed without the emission of high energy particles.? In addition, additional ideas, associated with Conventional Condensed Matter physics, are used to extend the earlier Ion Band State (IBS) model by C&C.? The general model clarifies the origin of coherent processes that initiate LENR?s, through the onset of ion conduction that can occur through ionic fluctuations in nanoscale crystals. In the case of PdDx , these fluctuations begin to occur as x -> 1 in sub-lattice structures with characteristic dimensions of 60 nm.? The resulting LENR?s are triggered by the polarization between injected d?s and electrons (immediately above the Fermi energy) that takes place in finite-size PdD crystals.? During the prolonged charging of PdDx , the applied, external electric field induces these fluctuations through a form of Zener tunneling that mimics the kind of tunneling, predicted by Zener, that is responsible for possible conduction (referred to as Zener-electric breakdown) in insulators.? But because the fluctuations are ionic, and they occur in PdD, nano-scale structures , a more appropriate characterization is Zener-ionic breakdown in nano-crystalline PdD.?

It models Bloch symmetry deuterons in a 2-dimensional metal lattice instead of the 3-dimensional metal lattice first used. Both IBS variants recognize that the required lattice symmetry has limited extent, with the reactive deuterons being bound inside a closed volume like a box. The reactive deuterons are confined within classical turning point boundaries, while within the box their density distributions are modulated by a lattice array potential. Strictly speaking, the IBS fusion theory is a many-body theory. Nuclear dd fusion is one of several LENR processes. Some LENR processes do not require many-body ions and support room temperature nuclear reactions using light ions in single-particle Bloch geometry. For example, the decay of metastable single-body Bloch-function 8Be seems to be the source of MeV alphas in Oriani's light/heavy water electrolysis, and in several co-deposition electrolysis CR39 studies, as described in ICCF14 Abstracts. The Oriani MeV alphas are side products of both light water and heavy water electrolysis, using either Pd or Ni cathodes, as shown in highly repeatable tests.

In particular, we proposed the idea that deuterium nuclei (deuterons) could occupy energy band states (ion band states)--analogous to the kinds of energy band states that electrons occupy in ordered solids--with the possibility of nuclear fusion.

We show that when the varying spectral emissivity of alumina is taken into account the calculated temperature is much lower, and estimated power out matches power in to within the experimental error, so resolving this anomaly.

It is also intended to further detail our tritium and neutron results that have been obtained with the Pd-Si-D system, originally presented at earlier workshops. A measure of reproducibility that was not evident in our previous work has been achieved partially due to the better detection sensitivity afforded by the use of low tritium deuterium and partially from the fact that the foil-wafer cells can be made with nearly identical electrical characteristics. This reproducibility has allowed us to narrow the optimum conditions for the experiment. While this experiment is rather different from the ""standard"" electrolytic cell or the Ti gas hydride experiment, similarities exist in that non equilibrium conditions are sought and the tritium generation levels are low and neutron emission is extremely weak. In contrast to many electrochemical cell experiments, the system used in these experiments is completely sealed during operation and uses no electrolyte.","tritium, neutron, Pd-Si, method, gas discharge, ICCF-2",896_ClaytorTNtritiumgen.pdf,,,

The deuterium, and over one atmosphere pressure, was circulated in a sealed loop containing the cell and an ionization chamber to measure the tritium increase as a function of time. After 4800 hours of data, spanning 10 cells (including deuterium and hydrogen controls), were collected with this system. Average tritium production has varied from 0.02 to 0.2 nCi/h. Due to experimental constraints we have not been able to measure neutron output with these cells while simultaneously measuring the tritium increase. The question of tritium contamination in the palladium has been primarily resolved by the development of techniques that allow the palladium powder or foil to be reused.

By carefully controlling the sputtering rate of the wire, runs have been extended to hundreds of hours allowing a significant amount (>10?s nCi) of tritium to accumulate. We will show tritium generation rates for deuterium-palladium foreground runs that are up to 25 times larger than hydrogen-palladium control experiments using materials from the same batch. We will illustrate the difference between batches of annealed palladium and as received palladium from several batches as well as the effect of other metals (Pt, Ni, Nb, Zr, V, W, Hf) to demonstrate that the tritium generation rate can vary greatly from batch to batch.","gas discharge,, tritium,, D2,, Pd",898_ClaytorTNtritiumpro.pdf,,,

At the level of nuclear ""modeling"", the lattice is rather successful at reproducing the major features of the historical models. To wit, the binding energies and nuclear radii predictions of the liquid-drop model [LDM] are reproduced in a close-packed lattice because the lattice is dominated by near-neighbor, two-body, nucleon-nucleon interactions, as in the LDM. The alpha particle substructure of nuclei, as postulated in the cluster models, is reproduced in a nucleon lattice with spin- and isospin-layering because a close-packed lattice inherently contains He4-like, tetrahedral nucleon clusters. Most importantly, the shells, subshells and ""magic"" numbers of the independent-particle model [IPM] are reproduced in the lattice on a purely geometrical basis ? a direct consequence of nucleon build-up from a central tetrahedron. That fact was noted (and illustrated in Physical Review!) by Eugene Wigner in 1937 ? who later won the Nobel Prize in Physics explicitly ""for his contributions to the theory of the atomic nucleus [...], particularly through the discovery and application of fundamental symmetry principles"". It is noteworthy that the exact same lattice described by Wigner achieves unification of the modern-day nuclear models using a realistic, short-range, nuclear potential ? and not the purely-theoretical, quark-based fiction of a long-range, nuclear ""mean field.""Models of the Atomic Nucleus goes beyond the traditional concerns of nuclear modeling in addressing the still-unexplained topics of the fragment asymmetry in fission, the millisecond instability of the so-called super-heavy nuclei, and the remarkable findings of transmutation of elements in low-energy nuclear reaction [LENR] studies. The book clearly illustrates the fact that, for resolution of any of these and other long-standing controversies in theoretical nuclear physics, it will be necessary to return to the many loose-ends and inconclusive qualitative arguments that have dominated nuclear structure theory since the 1930s.",Theory,923_CookNmodelsofth.pdf,,,

Today most LENR research focuses on the former issues, while nuclear structure theory remains the same conundrum that it has been for 80 years. The essence of the problem is that there has been no self-consistent spatiotemporal description of nuclear structure ? and, as a consequence, no reliable framework within which to address the oldest and most outstanding problem in nuclear physics: the nuclear force. The unanswered question in traditional nuclear physics ? and the new challenge in LENR ? is how to reconcile the short-range nuclear force known from nucleon scattering experiments with the wealth of empirical data on nuclear structure. Despite problems due to the early rejection of spatiotemporal explanations in nuclear physics, 21st century computational power has opened the door to realistic ""molecular dynamics""-style simulations of nuclear structure.

Critical factors include the selection of the palladium and the experimental protocol during the initial loading to the beta phase. It was found that bubble patterns, volume expansion, and surface appearance can be used as early predictors of ultimate success. Since large scale defects are detrimental, methods of avoiding cracking are discussed. These include alloying, preparing a uniform surface, loading at a slow rate at low temperatures, delaying use of additives to the electrolyte, and uniform loading techniques. Methods of achieving the later and larger heat releases were found to include: rapid increase in the current density above a threshold value and raising the temperature. A reflux calorimeter design is presented that allows for continuous studies at boiling temperatures of the electrolyte. Unexpected and unexplained occurrences of heat bursts by magnetic fields and radio frequency fields are reported.","heat, method, Pd, D2O, ICCF-4, electrolysis",935_CravensDfactorsaff.pdf,,,

The method is patterned after mathematics used in Michaelis-Menten kinetic models, which are standard in enzyme catalytic studies. Hydrogen is found to inhibit the deuterium reaction rates and can be explained by mixed inhibition kinetics where the hydrogen both competes with deuterium at the active sites requiring higher concentrations of deuterium for a given reaction rate and it also undergoes noncompetitive inhibition, which alters the maximum rate of the reaction. This kinetic model predicts that hydrogen contamination would require ligher loading ratios for similar reaction rates or heat production and also such contamination may lower ultimate heat production due to hydrogen active site complex productions.","Gas loading, Inhibition, Kinetics",943_BiberianJPjcondensedc.pdf,,290.0,298.0

Four experimental approaches are being pursued: electrolysis, glow-discharge, gas loading in catalyst cells and high-pressure high-temperature cell with ultrasonic wave excitation. The experimental setups developed by ET are described along with preliminary results obtained. A significant amount of excess heat was measured in the first glow discharge experiment. The power generated during the experiment was up to 3.9 times the input power. When driven with waves the excess heat was higher than when driven with DC. A significant amount of excess heat was also measured after the shutdown of the glow discharge; it lasted for approximately 10 hours. The total excess energy generated is estimated to be 6.7 times the input energy. The ""heat-after-death"" phenomenon was also observed in another glow discharge experiment. Excess heat up to approximately 80% was measured over a period of over 3 months in yet another glow discharge experiment. Driving the electrolytic cells with waves resulted in a faster loading than when driving them with DC of the same average current. The tritium concentration in the electrolyte measured at the end of the experiments was found to be up to more than 100% the pre-experiment level. No excess heat was measured, so far, in the catalyst cells. Successful loading of Pd target with D was obtained in the high-pressure high-temperature gas cell without going through the alpha+beta phase of the Pd-D system.","excess heat, electrolysis, glow discharge",990_DardikIintensific.pdf,,,

Martin Fleischmann, who in his early career was a colleague of Paneth, teamed with Stanley Pons at the University of Utah to pursue this goal by the electrolysis of heaNy water with a palladium cathode. Palladium is a metalwhich strongly absorbs hydrogen isotopes. The question they sought to answer was whether the internal pressure generated by this absorption would be sufficient to overcome the coulomb repulsion of deuterium nuclei. In 1989 they claimed success in fusing deuterium nuclei to form helium 2.

The device consists of diodes fabricated as powder, with a large surface junction made up of a semiconductor in contact with palladium charged with deuterium.The apparent fusion reactions take place in the junction between the semiconductor and the Palladium powder, which produces an excitation which is transmitted to the electrons. This excitation increases their energy and allows them to cross the bandgap of the semiconductor and pass into the conduction band, as in a photovoltaic cell. This energy very quickly appears as a spontaneous potential difference which can reach over 0.5 volt per junction.The potential drop concentrates on the junction region, and at a nano scale the electric field reaches considerable values, higher than the megavolt per meter, which constrains the deuterium nuclei and increases the probability of deuterium fusion.",Excess heat,1017_DavidFselfpolari.pdf,,,

Near the surface of other metal oxides, closely spaced hydrogen at a distance of only 2 pm at least during a fraction of the time has been detected, and has been proposed to be in the form of hypothetical ultradense Rydberg matter H(0). How can H(0) form in PC near the cathode interface? Nanometric cavities (NC) were observed in the PC near their cathode interfaces. These NC would contain H2 precipitates with impurities, under a pressure of the order of 0.1 GPa. Since PC are crossed by a large flux of protons, a simple mechanism is proposed to increase the H2 pressure in these NC rapidly and temporarily well above the PC tensile strength. A second mechanism is then described to turn this H2 into a metallic-molecular state, form a Rydberg matter H(1) and then H(0) with a pressure decrease. In NC, the presence of impurities and the entry of the hydrogen atoms in the form of Rydberg atoms are proposed to decrease the pressure required to form metallic-molecular hydrogen. Finally, different experiments are proposed to test this research approach, particularly by transmission electron microscopy and Raman micro-spectroscopy.","H2 precipitates, Impurities, Large hydrogen flux, Nanometric cavities, Partial metallization of hydrogen, Pressure, Proton conductors, Rydberg states",1031_BiberianJPjcondensedt.pdf,,31.0,44.0

These experiments were characterized by a substantial lack of reproducibility. On the other side, it has become more and more clear that reaching, and possibly exceeding, a threshold in the amount of Deuterium absorbed in the lattice (usually called the DlPd ratio) is a necessary condition in order to produce excess heat (DlPd ~ 0.9 atomic). These considerations pushed the Group to concentrate its activity in the study of the connection between the Palladium characteristic parameters and the maximum reachable D/Pd ratio, by analysing and interpreting the relative absorption mechanisms. Mastering this aspect of the experiment should allow obtaining reproducibly high charging ratios, well above the quoted threshold, and thus hopefully reproducible production of heat excess.This has been done in the last year, with quite promising results, that will be reported in this paper.","heat+, Pd, D2O, electrolysis, stress, D/Pd, ICCF-6",1032_NEDOthesixthin.pdf,,160.0,168.0

Nevertheless, fruitful activity has been performed following two main lines. The first line attains to the effort for reaching high values of D/Pd ratio in Pd in order to obtain the best conditions for cold fusion phenomena, in particular power excess production in electrolytic cells. The outcome of this research is the definition of the starting characteristic of Pd (metallurgy), and the procedure for its loading with Deuterium. The calorimetry by now assessed at ENEA Frascati has been used for the detection of power excess. The second line concerns the attempt to detect in a clear way the production of 4He during the power excess episodes. A system aimed to the analysis of the gases evolving from the electrolytic cell is being realised and will be briefly described.","film, D2, D2O, Pd, Ni, loading, diffusion, stress, ICCF-7",1043_DeNinnoAcoldfusion.pdf,,,

The most interesting feature of this device was its simplicity and apparently its high reproducibility (the device was already replicated by other researchers). In designing the experiments the first concern was to exclude any parasitic effect due to electromagnetic interferences, noise, instrumentation drift and other conventional (but not obvious) effects. To this end, a series of control experiments were designed and performed before the actual replication. The second aim was to design a very simple structure that can be easily modified and reutilized in order to allow a variety of tests.","Lattice Energy Converter, LEC",1070_DiStefanoAexperiment.pdf,,,

After the material is given the opportunity to reabsorb water from air the reaction and excess heat production in the presence of deuterium resumes.

When the amount of generated heat is small, it is important to characterize the calorimeter to account for possible measurement errors, or artifacts, which can result in long-term apparent excess heat. In this paper we investigate one of those possible measurement artifacts applicable to the gas loading systems that (1) use thermometry as a proxy for energy flow measurements, and (2) run at elevated temperatures. When loading gas into Pd-impregnated alumina, we have found that thermal gradients inside the system result in apparent heating or cooling of the measuring system. We experimentally magnified this effect and confirmed that it was due to temperature nonuniformity inside the calorimetric system. We quantified the effect using a numerical simulation tool to show that a temperature gradient as small as 0.5 K/m might result in 50 mW of apparent excess heat""generation"". We suggest a simple approach for investigators to account for this measurement artifact by calibrating their systems with helium gas either prior to, or at the end of, the experimental sequence.","Calibration, Gas-loading, Heat, Measurement, Palladium",1088_BiberianJPjcondensedl.pdf,,116.0,123.0

High deuterium loading ratio ( > 0.9 ) has been identified as a necessary condition for initiating low energy nuclear reaction in palladium material. However, electrochemical loading of deuterium to the concentrations above 0.75 has its own challenges. While loading concentrations above 0.95 have been reported, the mechanism responsible for such elevated loading levels is still unknown. Our recent experiments gave an indication that the use of certain dopants modifies the process of deuterium adsorption on palladium surfaces. Such modifications promote deuterium loading to higher concentrations.

We showed that high hydrogen loading and the presence of impurities in Pd and Ni can lower the adsorption energy, thus increasing hydrogen surface mobility potentially improving the reaction rate.

The excess power reportedly occurs in palladium electrodes highly loaded with deuterium. Other anomalous effects such helium-4, tritium and low energy radiation production have also been reported. This report summarizes the experimental results from a number of electrochemical loading/calorimetric experiments on palladium electrodes run at NRL. The experiments were carried out with the purpose of replicating the published excess power results obtained at the other Navy laboratories and with the goal of identifying the experimental conditions necessary to produce anomalous effects. Most of the experiments described were attempts to electrolytically load pure palladium or palladium alloy cathodes with deuterium (or hydrogen) and then to measure the power produced in the electrolytic cells. Loading was monitored in situ by measuring the change in the axial resistance of the cathode and comparing the measure values with the known relationship between resistance and the D(H)/Pd atomic ratios. While attaining high levels of deuterium loading in palladium cathodes was difficult we found that using materials with a large grain microstructure facilitated the loading. Calorimetric measurements on the highly loaded cathodes were initially made in isoperibol calorimeters that had a sensitivity of ?10%. No excess power (200 mW) and no radiation above the background were measured in any of the experiments described. Highly sensitive heat conduction calorimeters were evaluated for their use with the electrochemical cells. Results showed that measurements at the ?10 mW level were possible in the heat conduction calorimeters when data were collected frequently and signal averaging was used. Another experiment that was investigated was the electrochemical codeposition of palladium and deuterium on cathodes. Again, no radiation above background levels was detected in these experiments.","Pd, electrolysis, heat+, neutron, gamma",1097_DominguezDasummaryof.pdf,,,

Long incubation times, on the order of weeks or months, are necessary presumably for the basic electrolyte to dissolve and redeposit essential impurities onto the cathode surface. To accelerate this process, we added chemical additives to the electrolyte once the palladium was loaded with deuterium. Chemicals that produce oxide interfaces on the palladium surface seemed to occasionally produce apparent excess power. A single Pd90Rh10 cathode generated a total apparent excess energy on the order of 10 kJ after a series of additions in an experiment that only took one week. The results are encouraging and may lead to an understanding of what triggers excess power production in Fleischmann-Pons-type experiments.

We observed excess energy bursts in the range 2.4?44.3 kJ in 6% of these experiments. Additionally, a conservative estimate of the total integrated output energy is greater than the total integrated input energy in these experiments. This paper documents the steps taken to examine these results thoroughly for calibration/measurement errors and instrumental artifacts. A 2.4 kJ energy burst is at least four times greater than the energy released by oxidizing deuterium in the cell headspace. The data and subsequent elimination of alternative explanations for excess energy production lead us to conclude that the excess energy is real and of yet unknown origin.","Calorimetry, Deuterium , Excess energy, Palladium",1101_BiberianJPjcondensedm.pdf,,21.0,34.0

With the vibrations, one deals with a large amplitude (fractions of an angstrom) time-periodic oscillations of a small group of atoms around their stable positions in the lattice, known also as discrete breathers, which can be excited in regular crystals as well as in QCs. On the other hand, phasons are a specific property of QCs, which are represented by very large amplitude (angstrom) oscillations of atoms between two quasi-stable positions determined by the geometry of a QC. Large amplitude atomic motion in LAVs and phasons may result in time-periodic driving of adjacent potential wells occupied by hydrogen ions (protons or deuterons). The rate of tunneling of the particle through the potential barrier separating the wells is shown to be drastically enhanced by the driving. These results support the concept of nuclear catalysis in QCs that can take place at special sites provided by their inherent topology.","Quasicrystals, Localized anharmonic vibrations, Low energy nuclear reactions, Nuclear active sites, Phasons, Tunneling",1123_BiberianJPjcondensedw.pdf,,87.0,98.0

This is a strong indication that hydrogen can trigger nuclear reactions that seem to involve the nuclei of the lattice (which would yield a fission-like pattern of products).

The most studied system (palladium/deuterium) has given birth to the ""Cold Fusion"" concept: a special kind of DD fusion reaction, only occurring in a metallic lattice, which yields heat and helium-4 as the main reaction product. Other systems have also been studied (nickel hydrogen and caesium/deuterium for instance), showing shifts in isotopic ratio of the products of reaction and leading to the more generalized concept of Low Energy Nuclear Reaction (LENR). A novel conjecture (the pico-gravity conjecture) is presented here, that may explain all the anomalies observed in this so-called ""Cold Fusion"" field. According to this conjecture, the main part of the energy produced in Low Energy Nuclear Reaction could be the result of a very special kind of chemical reactions (pico-chemical reactions), induced by a considerable increase of gravity at pico-meter distances (pico-gravity). True nuclear signatures (α-particles emission for instance) could also occur according to the pico-gravity conjecture. But they should be many orders of magnitude lower than would be expected from the energy produced (which is observed experimentally). This conjecture will be tested by analysing the products of the reaction of hydrogen isotopes with selected metals.","Cold fusion, Gravity, Isotopic shift, LENR, Low Energy Nuclear Reactions",1139_BiberianJPjcondensed.pdf,,53.0,67.0

Antoine Lavoisier (1743-1794) developed in 1783 a calorimetric method based on the measurement of the mass of the ice that melts when heated. Robert Bunsen (1811-1899) improved this method in 1870 and designed a calorimeter based on the measurement of the volume rather than the mass of ice melted. Nowadays this method is still used [1] because it is simple, accurate, sensitive and most of all rather insensible to interference, which is a key point in order to have convincing experiment in a controversial field. Moreover, an ice calorimeter is adiabatic and isotherm (0?C) thus suppressing the problem of heat transfer in wires and tubing connecting the experiment to the outside of the calorimeter. It is an integrating calorimeter that measures enthalpy.","Calorimeter, method",1140_DufourJasimplecal.pdf,,,

Two D's fuse to 4He, and the energy is converted by expulsion of the third deuteron. Measurable fusion occurs when two D's are confined within 0.1 angstrom of each other. Three boson (efimov) interactions can have longer range than two boson interactions. The best known example is triple alpha fusion to carbon-12 in stars. Triple deuterium interaction could perhaps be possible in the 0.5-1.0 angstrom range; the distance between D's in a D2  molecule are 0.74 angstrom. The hypothesis accounts for the low reproducibility and short duration of the effect because of rapid destruction of the active structure by sputtering, radiation damage, bubble formation and chemical reduction of the impurities to compounds like D2O, ND3, CD4, or BD3.

The device has been used to determine the heating power of a plasma electrolysis (the Ohmori-Mizuno experiment). We confirm that in this experiment, the heat output from electrolysis is greater than the electrical power input.

One of these principles has been the prediction that the partial molar enthalpy of absorption of hydrogen (or  deuterium) in palladium (5) will become positive at the high charging ratios (X = DlPd) required for excess enthalpy generation (6,7), see Fig 1.Although a transition from exothermic to endothermic absorption is probably not a necessary condition for achieving excess enthalpy generation at elevated temperaturesl , such a transition will certainly facilitate the achievement of high charging ratios. For example, increases of temperature will then themselves lead to increases in X and thereby in the rates of excess enthalpy generation. These are the conditions required for the development of ""positive feedback"" and; in this paper, we report on two lines of investigation which have indicated the presence of these effects. We then outline the way in which our understanding of this phenomenon has guided our investigation of excess enthalpy generation at elevated temperatures.","D2O, Pd, electrolysis, heat, positive feedback, enthalpy of formation, ICCF-5",1282_PonsSproceeding.pdf,,157.0,168.0

Introduction I have been asked on several occasions during the last ten years to provide a commentary on subjects such as the Sociology of Science, Social Responsibility in Science etc. with special reference to the topic of ""Cold Fusion"".? I have always been reluctant to do so for two principal reasons.??? The first is that I believe that the consideration of these topics is premature.?? The reason is that I am convinced that there is much more information which bears on such topics which will be revealed in the fullness of time.? Furthermore, there are aspects of the past history, developments and, indeed, of the science which I do not wish to discuss even at the present time. Inevitably, therefore, any such article will be incomplete, will lack focus and will be couched in rather general terms.? This is the way the present article has turned out to be; in view of the evident deficiencies, it should only be taken as a first step in trying to develop a discussion of the important Social Issues.",,1285_Fleischmanreflection.pdf,,,

Secondly, the electric field in the cavity (to be shown below) superimposed on this deuteron-pair would lower the Coulomb barrier between them facilitating a 'Low Energy Fusion' reaction. Furthermore, neutron exchange reaction between two deuterons (in an analogous manner like the electron exchange that forms a Deuterium molecule) is like a 'Long Range' force (as compared to the range of nuclear force) that can pull two deuterons together. This range is longer than that of the pi-plus exchange nuclear force between a proton and a neutron, because neutrons are charge neutral.

There are few analytical methods that can detect trace amounts of 4He in the presence of D2. Most commercial magnetic sector mass spectrometers are large and expensive and, while they have excellent ?m/m resolution, they still require some additional separation of He, such as a getter system to achieve ppb sensitivity. We have developed a lower cost, compact system that allows us to measure 4He down to sub ppm levels in D2 and other gasses. This system utilizes a column of activated carbon cooled with liquid nitrogen (LN2) that effectively absorbs everything but helium. Post absorption, the system uses an MKS Microvision residual gas analyzer (RGA) and a Stanford Research Systems (SRS) RS 100 RGA to check for helium purity. The helium eluted from the column is quantified by a small magnetic sector mass spectrometer tuned to mass 4. A typical sample size required to achieve ppb sensitivity to 4He is 50 cm3 at 50 Torr. Calibrations have been done with air, 4He in D2 at various concentrations and show a 3% variation from standard sample to standard sample. We will discuss the typical operation of this instrument and show results from various calibrations using different carrier gases.","Chromatographic gas separation, Helium analysis, LENR product analysis, Mass spectrometry, Trace gas analysis",1310_BiberianJPjcondensedzb.pdf,,307.0,317.0

Analysis of a sample population of these types of tracks suggests detection of magnetically charged particles with faster-than-light velocities. Particle kinetic energy was estimated from energy deposition and momentum was estimated from track curvature in magnetic fields. Measured values were plotted on a kinetic energy versus momentum graph and were found to fall in the v > c region. Track curvature was found to be parabolic, which is a signature for monopoles. Using the classical theory of tachyons, the plane of parabolic curvature suggests electrically charged tachyons detected as slower-than-light monopoles. Preliminary lower limits for particle mass are found. Further study is suggested to broaden this search.","Detection, Mass Estimate, Monopoles, Parabolic curvature, Photographic emulsion, Superluminal, Tachyons",1334_BiberianJPjcondensedn.pdf,,210.0,237.0

Some Russian and French researchers have considered these particles to be magnetic monopoles. The mechanisms of energy deposition and track formation, while among the most important properties, are contradictory and the least understood of all of the observations. Our method of producing these tracks differs markedly from most other studies in that no electrical discharge is used as a source. Rather, tracks are created with a simple uniform exposure to photons. This simpler method of producing exactly the same tracks supports a more comprehensive exploration of particle track properties. Out of 750 exposures with this method, elliptic particle tracks were detected, 22 of which were compared to Bohr?Sommerfeld electron orbits in an idealized model. Ellipses fitted to the tracks were found to have quantized semi-major axis sizes with ratios of ? n2/a2 to corresponding Bohr?Sommerfeld hydrogen ellipses. This prompts inquiry relevant to magnetic monopoles due to the n2/a2 force difference between magnetic charge and electric charge using the Schwinger quantization condition. Analogy with the electron indicates that the elliptic tracks could be created by a bound magnetically charged particle with mass mm = 1.45 ? 10^-3 eV/c2, yet with superluminal velocities. Using a modified extended relativity model, mm becomes the relativistic mass of a superluminal electron, with m0 = 5.11 ? 10^5 eV/c2, the fine structure constant becomes a mass ratio and charge quantization is the result of two states of the electron. Relevance of this new model is considered in light of the observed inconsistencies in track formation.","Elliptic orbits, Faster-than-light, Kepler orbits, LENR, Monopoles, Particle tracks, Photographic emulsion, Strange radiation, Superluminal, Tachyons",1335_BiberianJPjcondensedzf.pdf,,151.0,173.0

This work aims at checking whether ""cold fusion"" fits in pathological science traits. For each type of experiment and year, this work counted the distinct research groups results (success or failure). Experimental results from many research groups suggest that nuclear reactions in solids are more complex than fusion (it is not only fusion) and that they need energy triggers like background radiation, meaning chemical configurations alone do not seem to generate nuclear reactions. Some types of experiments present rising trends (the field does not fit in pathological science model) and have potential to bring disruptive technologies.

The calculated probability of fusion within a microcrack, in the presence of D2 loading at room temperature and for impure metals, shows moderately elevated values compared with the probability of fusion on the surface. For all the temperatures in the 150-350 K range and for all the energies between 150 and 250 eV, the formation of microcracks increases the probability of fusion compared to non-deformed lattices, and also reduces the thickness of the Coulomb barrier. Using the trend of the curve of potential to evaluate the influence of the concentration of impurities, a very high barrier is found within the pure lattice (J ? 0.25%). However, under the same thermodynamic conditions, the probability of fusion in the impure metal (J ? 0.75%) could be higher, with a total energy less than the potential so that the tunneling effect is amplified. Finally, we analysed the influence of forced D2 loading on the process.","Collective plasmonic excitation, Dislocations, Fusion within a microcrack, Tunneling effect",1356_BiberianJPjcondensed.pdf,,47.0,52.0

Further, in this paper, we have taken the interaction between deuteron-optical photons, we want to clarify this point, of course, these photons have a vibrational frequency of interest because it was discovered that the interaction between photons and deuterons causes the Coulomb barrier is not static, that has of oscillations in different directions within the lattice. So we can conclude that this phenomenon of cold fusion that breaks new ground in modern nuclear physics. In recent years, over 20 years, have seen thousands of experiments and theoretical models to explain the phenomenon of fusion at low energy (LENR) in specialized heavy hydrogen systems. We can say that a new possible way to obtain nuclear energy without waste is emerging. Nevertheless in spite of experimental contributions, the theoretical framework is not known. In this work, we try to explain the deuteron-deuteron reactions within palladium lattice by means of the coherence theory of nuclear and condensed matter. The coherence model of condensed matter affirms that within a deuteron-loaded palladium lattice there are three different plasmas: electrons, ions and deuterons plasma. Then, according to the loading percentage x = D/Pd, the ions deuterium can take place on the octahedrical sites or in the tetrahedral in the (1,0,0)-plane. In the coherence theory it is called ?-plasma the deuterons plasma in the octahedral site and ? -plasma which in tetrahedral. We propose a general model of effective local time-dependent deuteron-deuteron potential, that takes into account the electrons and ions plasma oscillations. The main features of this potential are extracted by means of many-body theory considering the interaction deuteron-phonon-deuteron. In fact the phonon exchange produces a attractive component between two deuteron within the D2 molecular. This attractive force is able to reduce the inter-nuclear distance from about 0.7 to 0.16 ?. It means that the lattice strongly modifies the nuclear environment with respect to free space. In this way according to deuterons energy, loading percentage and plasma frequency we are able to predict high o low tunneling probability. The fusion rates (s-1) computed vary from 10^-70 to 10^-17 and also a set of other mechanism, which could be enhanced these values, are proposed. In this way we hope that by means of this approach in the future will be possible to realize and control the nuclear exothermic reactions that take place in the condensed matter in order to obtain clean energy.","Cold fusion, Coulomb barrier, d-d Reactions, Many body",1359_BiberianJPjcondensedg.pdf,,7.0,17.0

Thirty-three experimental runs with excess heat production indicated that there is no clear correlation between the excess power and the D/Pd ratio. Most excess heat occurs when the ratio is 0.5 < D/Pd < 0.7. Three different cathode pretreatments were tested. It is found that the excess heat reproducibility rate is 2/11 (18%), 21/32 (66%) and 25/50 (50%), and maximum excess power of 45 +/1 18 mW, 117 +/- 24 mW and 128 +/- 19 mW were achieved for samples etched in aqua regia, heated in D2SO4 and open electrolyzed in D2SO4, respectively, based on 93 runs of calorimetry with 25 Pd plates. This indicates that heating and open electrolyzing in D2SO4 are effective methods of pretreatment for excess heat production in subsequent electrolysis. Surface characterizations with 3D non-contact optical profiling, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) were performed for Pd samples of cold rolled, pretreated and electrolyzed. The results showed that the surface roughness of palladium increases prominently after pretreatment. New element silver was detected on Pd surface after electrolysis.","Current density, Surface roughness, Temperature, Transmutation",1399_BiberianJPjcondensedw.pdf,,54.0,71.0

It is not so much the magnitudes of the steady state loading ratio, but rather creation of non-equilibrium conditions which facilitates rapid migration/transport of deuterons within the Pd lattice that seems to be required.

Being sceptical from the beginning, the many negative reports from renowned laboratories seemed to confirm that the disputed claims of cold fusion occurring in a solid were, unfortunately, based on the erroneous interpretation of ill-defined experiments. I now realize that in the meantime many new positive results have been published which can not be pushed aside quite so easily. Two reviews, currently in the course of publication, were very helpful and yielded much information on the present situation. These are the reviews of M. Srinivasan and E. Storms. Together with my reading and the lectures given on the first days of the conference, I eventually felt able to present my impressions in a lecture on the last day of the conference, as the organizers had requested. I am aware that all the arguments pro and contra the reality of cold fusion have been pointed out by others before. The first part of my contribution to the report of this conference is therefore mainly a reminder of the problems. In the second part I raise some questions seen with the eyes of a physical chemist being specially experienced in electrochemistry.","review, critique, history, ICCF-2, surface",1416_SIFthescience.pdf,,480.0,489.0

The tubing and solution were heated to a steady state temperature of 249?C using an FR heater. Hydrogen at 1100 psig was applied to the inside of the tubing. After the application of hydrogen, a 32?C increase in temperature of the cell was measured which corresponds to 25 watts of heat. Heat production under these conditions is predicted by the theory of Mills where a new species of hydrogen is produced that has a lower energy state then normal hydrogen.

Key cathode characteristics considered important for these non-Joule heating reactions, as documented in a US patent application, are discussed. These concepts are incorporated into an electrolytic reactor system to encourage these reactions while discourage Joule heating of the electrolyte. However, even the more efficient reactor designs appear to have diminishing returns upon scale up. The MultiCell unit?s unique design allows for repetitive replication of the unit (much like a component on a circuit board or computer chip) to acquire the desired power output while still maintaining the efficiency of the small MultiCell unit.

This statement is valid even for the newly born light-water excess energy experiments [1].

The trajectories of the particles were calculated by numerically solving a system of differential equations of mechanics. Relativistic equations were used, and the interaction of particles was considered Coulombic without taking into account magnetic effects. About 104 stories were modeled, each of them containing up to 100 collisions of free electrons with a hydrogen atom. The total number of simulated atoms that experienced collisions was ~ 10^6. Dynamic modeling revealed the formation of neutral particles consisting of protons (deuterons) with an electron rotating around them in nonstationary, close to elliptical orbits with an apogee to a distance of less than 10^-11 cm and to a perigee of ~ 10^-12 cm. These particles, which are continuously changing in size and shape, are up to 3 to 4 orders of magnitude smaller than ordinary hydrogen atoms, and 1-2 orders of magnitude larger than neutrons. Such nonstationary hydrogen miniatoms can exist for a short time (on our estimate, up to ~ 10^-12 sec.) in the environment of free electrons of metals, easily move in them and, like neutrons, approach the nuclei of isotopes of hydrogen or other elements at a distance at which nuclear fusion reactions or transmutation of elements are possible due to the tunneling effect. Taking into account the formation of such hydrogen miniatoms the previously calculated rate of low-energy nuclear reactions in metals1^-6 increases more than by 5 ? 6 orders of magnitude, that is, to values corresponding to experimental data. Formation of hydrogen miniatoms in the medium of free electrons is of primary importance in the mechanism of low-energy nuclear reactions.","LENR, Molecular dynamics, Hydrogen mini-atoms",1453_BiberianJPjcondensedzi.pdf,,213.0,218.0

A LEC converts the internal energy within the lattice of some materials, such as palladium, or of gases occluded within the lattice, such as hydrogen or deuterium, into ionizing radiation and electrical energy. Experiments include tests where the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of the LEC were measured when an external voltage/current was applied, as well as other I-V tests where the spontaneous LEC voltage was measured as a function of temperature and resistance. LEC voltage and current has been shown to increasewith increased temperature. The electrical power produced by a LEC is similar to that produced by a nuclear battery however, a LEC does not require radioactive materials. While the energy levels produced to date are several orders of magnitude below those required formost power sources, the calculated flux of ionizing radiation necessary to produce the experimentally measured voltage and currentwould require the equivalent of several curies of radiation.

To measure the excess heat, a calibration curve of the input power vs temperature of the LiOD + D2O solution was obtained for cells equal in shape, materials and operating in the same experimental condition in which the experiment was actually performed. The unique difference was on the cathode. The cathode used in the calibration measurements was made of palladium rod gold-plated by electrochemical deposition. Neutron detector is a 3He proportional counter, the same used in the previous experiments, but the data acquisition is now Implemented by a fast pulse-shape storage and off-line discrimination for a very accurate counting. The findings of the experiment, lasted about 50 days, are: i) dependent on the type of the cathode, specific excess power values up to 96 W/cm3 was found; ii) specific excess power showed linear dependence from the current density with a threshold at around 150 mA/cm2; iii) the cathode swelling was dependent from the type of the cathode and in the case of rods it increased with the current density; iv) no evidence of nuclear products statistically significant was detected.","Pd, D2O neutron tritium gamma emission heat+ Current density ICCF-2 electrolysis",1477_SIFthescience.pdf,,36.0,63.0

In the melted cathode, the data of which are reported, no 4He was found at the achieved sensitivity. X-ray film, positioned at 50 mm from the cell, roughly gave the image of the cathode through spots. Extended considerations have been made to explain this evidence on the basis of the bundle nature of the cathode. From these considerations, the energy of the radiation and the total energy associated to it have been estimated as 89 keV and 12 kJ, respectively. This value is :0.5% of the energy measured by calorimetry in the same interval of time.

Initially, an attempt was made to replicate the work at NRL in collaboration with MHI. When replication proved difficult, another set of experiments were conducted at MHI in three sets consisting of two control blanks and one positive foil (that should have transmuted Cesium to Praseodymium) per set. Foil samples were split for analysis at both NRL and MHI. Extensive analytical work was performed to characterize the foils and the blanks. When extracted at MHI, low nanogram amounts of Pr were found by ICP-MS on 3 of 3 foils that should have had Pr whereas the 6 controls were blank. Split solutions of these extracts were also tested independently at NRL and the presence of Pr was confirmed. The Pr found did not have the characteristic rare earth contamination expected if the Pr was from the environment and thus looked like it was produced in the experiment. Unfortunately, we could not find Pr at NRL (even at trace levels) on our split foil samples no matter what extraction method was employed. After considering and evaluating several unlikely scenarios for these disparate results, we visited MHI and participated in the extraction process on new foils. These extracts were blank when tested at both laboratories. Environmental samples were obtained at various locations where samples were handled. Pr was found in large amounts at one location used in sample preparation and this Pr had the signature of pure material rather than an inadvertent contaminate. No record of how it got there could be established. Other rare and characteristic impurities also were found in the extracts from MHI that were present in the laboratory environment. Thus, we concluded that the transmutation of Cs to Pr when deuterium permeated MHI?s multilayer structure could not be firmly established, as contamination during the foil production or during the foil analysis could not be ruled-out. The design of the replication experiments, the lessons learned, and the results will be discussed.",,1486_GrabowskiKevaluation.pdf,,,

The improved prospects of LENR in the past few years are indicated by the significant numbers and varied locations of researchers in several countries, a large body of accumulated evidence, major advances in explanation and theory development, and recent favourable occurrences, including a plethora of proposed energy-producing devices. The changing landscape creates policymaking opportunities for supporting LENR to realize its potential benefits, planning proactively to deal with anticipated adverse secondary impacts, and integrating the updates in a comprehensive policy program. The first policymaking opportunity, updates of current policies for LENR support, may best be accomplished in a framework of evidence-based policymaking. The level of evidence for the existence of LENR is at least a preponderance of evidence (greater than 50% probability). There may even be clear and convincing evidence (greater than 70%). Correspondingly, the policy response should be at least reinstatement and research comparable to other emerging energy technologies. Enhanced support, perhaps on a par with hot fusion, is indicated if there is clear and convincing evidence. The second policymaking opportunity related to LENR?s changing landscape is to address potential adverse secondary impacts with proactive planning. Broad deployment of LENR for energy supply may be expected to have major secondary impacts as a disruptive technology. Direct impacts will take place on all phases of the energy chain ? supply, transport, storage, and consumption. Indirect impacts will be felt most by the components of society that are closely tied to the energy cycle, such as sectors of the workforce and energy-based communities. Technology assessment is a mature and readily available methodology for identifying secondary impacts and developing mitigative measures. A third policymaking opportunity is to integrate LENR policy updates that are needed as demonstrated by its changing landscape. Policies for mitigating adverse secondary impacts, for example, can be formulated based on policies for LENR support and the resulting pace of its development and deployment. New and updated policies may also be integrated at the national and international level and between the public and private sectors. The public interest will be served by update and integration of LENR policies for its development and mitigating its impacts. However, many challenges must be overcome to achieve the update and integration objectives. The world desperately needs new sources of clean and inexpensive energy. The case of cold fusion would perhaps be a curiosity in the history of science if the stakes were not so high.",,1523_BiberianJPjcondensedr.pdf,,96.0,105.0

The LENR Research Documentation Initiative (LRDI) is underway to mitigate the loss of records of investigators who began their work shortly after the announcement and are now leaving the field. The LRDI began with a pilot project with Edmund Storms and now includes 15 participants. Projects typically include publications, unpublished reports, electronic and hardcopy files, lab descriptions and notebooks, publications by others (LENR library), and photos, recordings and other media. The records found in an LRDI project are supplemented with one or more rounds of recorded and transcribed interviews. Where possible, timelines of LENR research are prepared. Each project is documented with memos for each component followed by a report of the investigator?s research contributions. Preservation of these records for additional review and analysis as progress is made in the field may contribute to the realization of LENR and its energy benefits.

LENR realization for the benefit of society will be enhanced by the forces of the free market. But government policy changes are needed to realize LENR benefits and deal with its anticipated disruptive impacts. Evidence-based policy making is a rational way to revisit negative policies for research support. Technology assessment is a candidate method for identifying and mitigating LENR?s adverse secondary effects.

An analysis of a general class of two-step coherent reactions involving charged nucleons has been performed, and very small reaction rates are found. This result is due to the small tunneling factors associated with coulomb repulsion.We are investigating two-step coherent reactions which begin through weak interaction mediated electron capture, which in hydrogen isotopes would produce off-shell (virtual) neutrons. No coulomb repulsion occurs for virtual neutrons. Virtual neutron capture by deuterons would yield tritium, and virtual neutron capture by protons would yield deuterons; the latter process is favored by a factor of 104 in the square of the matrix element on a per nucleon basis, and corresponds to a heat-producing reaction. The nuclear reaction energy would be coupled into the electrolysis process, with the final reaction products stationary.We have found that the weak interaction process can in principle be superradiant in the Dicke sense. If so, then considerable acceleration of this type of coherent reaction may occur.","theory, ICCF-1, coherent",1561_NCFIthefirstan.pdf,,118.0,137.0

If a large energy quantum cannot be transferred, then it is unlikely that any theory will be able to account for the claims.Our efforts have focused then on the problem of anomalous energy transfer. We have developed a new theoretical description that places delocalized lattice phonon degrees of freedom on the same footing as local residual position operators. With this formulation, we have found that a lattice vibrational mode cannot accept a large energy quantum, as the coupling is not sufficiently nonlinear. We propose a new set of second order reactions in which a local exothermic reaction couples off-resonance to a highly excited phonon mode at low order, and the phonon mode dissipates the large energy quantum through low order coupling to endothermic channels.","theory, energy transfer, ICCF-7",1572_ENECOtheseventh.pdf,,140.0,146.0

To interact, deuterons must get close to one another, and we consider conditions under which this occurs and the ramiﬁcations. Within the general picture under discussion, anomalies are ultimately a consequence of phonon exchange that occurs when nuclear reactions take place in the solid state. We review the generalization of the resonating group method for reactions in vacuum to include solid state effects, and discuss implications for experiment. Phonon exchange in the case of a much simpliﬁed scalar Gaussian nuclear model is reviewed. The coupling of reactions at different sites is explored, and connections are made with recent experiments on alpha emission. The fastest site-other-site reactions are null reactions in which fusion reactions and their inverses are coupled. A consideration of these processes leads to the conclusion that compact states should be present stabilized by phonon exchange, and that these may be responsible for anomalies in recent beam experiments with metal deuterides. Energy exchange between nuclei and the lattice can be very efficient, according to results from idealized models for null reactions involving many sites.

From earlier studies, screening is thought to be similar to the case of molecular D2 . Resonant tunneling has been advocated in the literature as a possible mechanism to achieve tunneling enhancements. We develop a two-level system for a piecewise constant potential model for resonant tunneling that matches the energy levels in the vicinity of a level crossing, arguing that such models are applicable for more general potential models. Resonant tunneling effects and dynamics, including acceleration due to coherence, are accounted for in the model. The model is extended to include relaxation effects, and it is found that one would not expect to find coherent effects associated with tunneling in the case of two deuterons in a metal lattice. We present a simple model for the transfer of excitation from a collection of deuterons to a collection of helium nuclei, a model closely related to resonant tunneling and also to new phonon-coupled SU(N) models under development.

Correlated with the excess heat appears to be 4He, with the associated energy near 24 MeV per helium atom. In nuclear reactions, the energy produced is expressed through the kinetic energy of the products; hence it would be natural to assume that some of the reaction energy ends up as kinetic energy of the 4He nucleus. Depending on the energy that the helium nucleus is born with, it will result in radiation (such as neutrons or x-rays) that can be seen outside of the cell. We have computed estimates of the expected neutron and x-ray emission as a function of helium energy, and compared the results with upper limits taken from experiments.

We have focused on the first approach, and we have found a model that seems to accomplish this. Here we introduce the model, which we call the ""lossy spin-boson model"". We find that energy exchange in the lossless spin-boson model is hindered due to destructive interference effects. Augmenting the model with loss removes the destructive interference, and we use perturbation theory on a specific example for illustration.

Here we introduce the local approximation, in which we assume that the matrix elements change little when an energy exchange event occurs. This approximation results in a periodic system when a resonance condition is satisfied, which is much easier to solve than the original problem. We consider a model problem where we analyze the self-energy and indirect coupling matrix elements numerically and in the local approximation, with good agreement.

Because of the strong Coulomb repulsion between the deuterons, the associated coupling matrix element is very small, and there is no possibility of converting the transition energy to oscillator quanta within a simple lossy spin-boson model. This motivates us to generalize to more complicated model that includes a set of (donor) two-level systems for the D2/ 4He transition, and a set of (receiver) two-level systems that are strongly coupled to the oscillator. We analyze the resulting model in the limit that the receiver system is very strongly coupled. Within this formulation, the associated dynamics can be interpreted in terms of a transition from D2 to 4He with direct conversion (and fractionation) of the large energy quantum to the oscillator, once the coupling with the receiver system is sufficiently strong.","Coherent Fusion, Donor-receiver Model, Excitation Transfer, Theory Excess Heat in the Fleischmann-Pons Experiment",1603_BiberianJPjcondensedd.pdf,,146.0,160.0

Since it may be possible that the lattice will respond to the mass change associated with a excited nuclear state, we adopt a relativistic description throughout based on a many-particle Dirac formalism. This approach has not been used in the past, perhaps due to the difficulty in separating the center of mass and relative degrees of freedom of the nuclear system, or perhaps due to an absence of applications for such a model. In response to some recent ideas about how to think about the center of mass and relative separation, we obtained from the Dirac model a new fundamental Hamiltonian in which the lattice couples to different states within the composite nuclei within the lattice. In this description the different nuclear states have different mass energies and kinetic energies, as we had expected. In addition there appear new terms which provide for nuclear excitation as a result of coupling to the composite momentum. This new effect comes about because of changes in the composite nuclear state as a result of the dynamical Lorentz boost in the lattice.","Theory, Condensed matter nuclear science, Fleischmann-Pons effect, Fundamental Hamiltonian, Lattice-nuclear coupling, Relativistic effects, Spin-boson model",1607_BiberianJPjcondensedf.pdf,,40.0,55.0

In response we have pursued models in which the large nuclear energy quantum is fractionated into a great many lower energy quanta. To connect these idealized models to the physical system we need to evaluate the associated coupling matrix elements. Recently we have found a new coupling mechanism that arises when a lattice model is derived starting from a Dirac description of individual nucleons; this coupling mechanism can be considered a generalization of spin-orbit coupling and produces interactions between the center of mass dynamics and internal nuclear degrees of freedom. In this work we develop a simplified model for 4He and molecular D2 states with which we evaluate the phonon exchange matrix element for D2/4He transitions based on the new interaction. We restrict our calculation to the central and tensor contributions of the Hamada-Johnston nucleon-nucleon potential, which are the strongest, and find coupling between ground state 4He and triplet P and F molecular states.

This has motivated us over the years to focus attention on models in which a large quantum is fractionated into a great many small quanta. We have found that many two-level systems with a large transition energy are able to exchange energy coherently with an oscillator with a much smaller characteristic energy as long as decay channels are present in the vicinity of the two-level transition energy. In previous work we analyzed this basic model, and obtained estimates for the coherent energy exchange rate in the strong coupling limit. In this work we consider a version of this model where the upper states of the two-level systems are unstable. In this case, there is no coherent energy exchange, but instead we find a dynamical polarization effect which we have analyzed. We extend the model to the case of three-level systems, and generalize the result to apply to general N-level systems. Coherent energy exchange is possible within the context of a donor and receiver model, where the receiver transitions have unstable upper states. We give results for the donor dynamics in this case. This model provides a foundation for a new kind of model that we put forth recently for which the predictions appear to be closely connected to experiment.","Coherent energy exchange, Fleischmann-Pons experiment, Lossy spin-boson model, Theory",1613_BiberianJPjcondensedj.pdf,,64.0,97.0

This model is the single most successful theoretical model that the ?eld has seen since it started; it has served as the theoretical justi?cation for a program at NASA; and it has accumulated an enormous number of supporters both within and outside of the condensed matter nuclear science community. The ?rst step in the model involves the proposed accumulation of mass by electrons through Coulomb interactions with electrons and ions in highly-excited coupled plasmon and optical phonon modes. Historically for us this mass increase has been hard to understand, so we were motivated in this study to understand better how this comes about. To study it, we consider simple classical models which show the effect, from which we see that the mass increase can be associated with the electron kinetic energy. The basic results of the simple classical model carry over to the quantum problem in the case of simple wave packet solutions. Since there are no quantum ?uctuations of the longitudinal ?eld in the Coulomb gauge, the resulting problem is conventional, and we ?nd no reason to expect MeV electron kinetic energy in a conventional consideration of electrons in metals. We consider the numerical example outlined in a primer on the Widom?Larsen model, and ?nd that multiple GW/cm2 would be required to support the level of vibrational excitation assumed in the surface layer; this very large power per unit area falls short by orders of magnitude the power level needed to make up the expected energy loss of the mass-enhanced electrons. We note that the mass enhancement of an electron in a transverse ?eld is connected to acceleration, so that the electron radiates. A similar effect is expected in the longitudinal case, and a very large amount of easily detected X-ray radiation would be expected if an MeV-level mass enhancement were present even in a modest number of electrons","Electric ?eld ?uctuations, Increased electron mass, LENR theory, Weak interaction models, Widom?Larsen theory",1614_BiberianJPjcondensedk.pdf,,23.0,45.0

When we modeled collimated X-ray emission in the Karabut experiment, we found that the conditions required by the model did not match the conditions of the experiment. One possible reason for this might be the neglect of phonon ?uctuations due to coupling with conduction electrons. We would like to add a description of this effect to our phonon?nuclear model; however, models normally used for electron?phonon interactions in metals are based on the Bloch picture, and we were concerned that it may not be well suited to the problem. This has motivated us to develop a new model for phonon ?uctuations in a metal that is based on the Born?Oppenheimer picture, within the context of a Brillouin?Wigner formulation. The Born?Oppenheimer results are complicated, so we have reduced them in a simpler ?xed-point picture (which is based on a Taylor series expansion of the Born?Oppenheimer approximation around ?xed nuclear equilibrium points). In order to verify the resulting formalism, we constructed a simpli?ed model for the monatomic crystal phonon dispersion relation, which is well known in the Bloch picture literature. From this model we are able to extract the longitudinal dielectric constant. We ?nd that the ?xed-point dielectric constant at second order is more accurate than the Bloch picture equivalent, and that it includes dynamic corrections that match the result from ?eld theory up to O(?2). This model is used in a subsequent paper for the development of phonon ?uctuation models, where it is found that the Bloch picture is appropriate when the metal sample is micron scale or larger, and that the Born?Oppenheimer picture is appropriate for nano-scale samples.","Phonon theory, Born-Oppenheimer approximation, phonon ?uctuations, fractionation",1615_BiberianJPjcondensedk.pdf,,74.0,109.0

In earlier work we developed a mathematical model (the lossy spin?boson model) which shows coherent energy exchange between two-level systems and an oscillator under conditions of fractionation. Recently, we have found an interesting physical model that is closely connected, and which is capable of coherent energy exchange with fractionation; this model is based on a relativistic description of composite nuclei in a lattice. In this work we present a much stronger development of the model directly from ?eld theory than given previously. In the lossy spin?boson model, the ability of the model to fractionate a large quantum depends on the presence of suitable loss mechanisms; the same is true in the case of the new physical model. The new model predicts anomalies such as excess heat without energetic nuclear radiation, 4He production, low-level gamma emission, and collimated X-ray emission in the Karabut experiment; however, as yet we have not demonstrated agreement between theory and experiment. Last summer we concluded (erroneously) that coupling with strong static transitions might impact the fractionation power of the model on dynamic transitions, and the resulting model appeared to be in agreement with our interpretation of the experiment. Here we review this kind of model more carefully, and ?nd that no such enhancement is present.

Collimated x-ray emission in the Karabut experiment we interpreted as demonstrating the conversion of vibrational energy to nuclear excitation, as predicted from the lossy spin-boson model; this motivated us to seek physical models that could account for the effect. We found that the coupling strength associated with electron?nuclear and electron?electron coupling was too weak to fractionate keV quanta into 100 MHz vibrations, which motivated us to seek a theory in which nuclear transitions coupled directly to vibrations. These considerations led us to a lattice model with a relativistic description of compound nuclei, in which a strong phonon-nuclear interaction is present. This interaction is normally rotated out with the Foldy?Wouthuysen transformation, but in the presence of strong loss mechanismsthis transformation becomes unhelpful. The model that results describes the coupling of vibrational energy to nuclear excitation, but earlier efforts to apply it to the Karabut experiment resulted in inconsistencies. This motivated us to analyze fluctuations due to electron-phonon coupling in metals, which we find here to be a weak effect for Bloch picture phonon exchange, and a somewhat stronger effect with Born?Oppenheimer phonon exchange. As no new physics were found to substantially enhance fractionation, we returned to the basic theory, and carried out a systematic analysis of the three different degrees of freedom that result from simple product approximations for the wavefunction. We find that when there are more virtual phonons than real, a significant enhancement of the coupling strength occurs, corresponding to a new anomalous regime. Conditions on the coupling matrix element and relative state occupation are derived for the anomalous regime, which favors strongly-coupled low energy transitions which constitute a largefraction of all nuclei present. The fractionation power of a sample in the anomalous regime is very much constrained, which allows us to be able to make predictions with the new model. We find that the 30.77 keV transition in 93Nb is likely to be in the anomalous regime in a Nb cathode; that the threshold fractionation energy is too low for excitation of the 30.77 keV transition; but that the threshold fractionation energy is high enough to result in the excitation of the 1565 eV transition in 201Hg, and x-ray emission in the few keV regime consistent with Karabut?s observations.","Collimated X-rays, Fractionation, Karabut experiment, Phonon?nuclear coupling, Phonon theory",1617_BiberianJPjcondensedl.pdf,,187.0,232.0

At high loading near room temperature, the gas pressure must be very high, and an ideal gas law no longer applies. In this case a knowledge of the fugacity is required to interpret and understand the results. We examine empirical models for the equation of state and fugacity of H2 which are relevant to the high pressure regime of interest, including an old model of Holley et al (1958), and the more modern models of Spycher and Reed (1988), Tkacz and Litwiniuk (2002), and Joubert (2010). At high pressure the more recent models are best, but the model of Tkacz and Litwiniuk diverges from the ideal gas equation of state at low pressure, which leads to an offset in the fugacity. We examine the difference between the equation of states for H2 and D2 in recent models, and find that the small difference at high pressure in the models of Tkacz and Litwiniuk agree best with experiment, while the larger difference in the models of Joubert (2010) and Joubert and Thiebaut (2011) is probably not reliable. We examine the possibility of developing a difference correction for the fugacity theoretically.

The closely related deuterium evolution reaction model describes deuterium loading in Pd cathodes in the Fleischmann?Pons experiment. We were interested in what issues were involved in the development of a high D/Pd loading, since over the years the importance of obtaining a high D/Pd ratio to obtain excess heat has been emphasized. In order to simplify things, we focus on the Volmer and Tafel reactions, and develop a steady state adsorption isotherm for the Vomer-Tafel regime. The adsorption isotherm is extended to become an absorption isotherm within a simplified picture that takes the surface sites to be equivalent to the bulk sites. While not a particularly good approximation, this allows us to model the D/Pd loading simply as a function of the overpotential, and hence the electrochemical current density. From a Tafel curve we can get some of the parameters for the Volmer current model, and from other eletrochemical data we can estimate the remaining Volmer and Tafel parameters. The resulting model fits the experimental data used well at low current density. Cathodes that load more highly with this approach require new models, potentially one for each cathode. We examine our earlier proposal that the differences in loading seen in experiment is due in part to large variations in the rate for internal D2 leaks. Consequently, we modify the Tafel reaction current model to account for internal leaks separately from the surface gas loss, and take advantage of data from the most highly loaded cathodes to estimate the surface Tafel reaction rate. Using this approach, the reference cathode that we used for our fits initially must have an internal leak rate more than two orders of magnitude higher than the rate of surface D2 loss. We conclude that minimizing the internal leaks is important in achieving high loading. Probably a key reason that there were so many negative results early in the field was because the cathode internal leak rate was very high in the cathodes used.","Deuterium evolution reaction, D/Pd loading, Overpotential, Tafel reaction, Volmer reaction",1621_BiberianJPjcondensedo.pdf,,51.0,68.0

However, we know very little about PdD at a loading near unity, and almost nothing about what happens when the loading exceeds unity. It may be that when the octahedral sites are fully occupied, additional interstitial deuterium atoms occupy tetrahedral sites, a proposal which at this point has little experimental support. It is nevertheless possible to construct an empirical model for this scenario, and to make use of available experimental data to fit the associated model parameters. We worked with empirical models for both PdD and PdH that assume an O-site energy quadratic in loading, and an O-site to T-site excitation which is either constant in loading, or else taken as an empirical function fit to estimates inferred from the analysis of experimental data. There are two empirical models, each with four or more free parameters; and insufficient experimental data from which to choose each parameter or function independently. We add supplementary constraints that presume the models for PdH and PdD must be very similar, which reduces the number of degrees of freedom within the models. This allows data from PdH to be used to construct a model for PdD, and vice versa. The models which result are interesting; they suggest these complicated systems might be understood based on a simple underlying picture; they indicate that there is more T-site occupation than has been appreciated previously in the literature; they indicate that the resistance ratio calibrations for PdH and PdD are inconsistent; and finally, measurements of the chemical potential at high loading have the potential to provide information about the O-site to T-site excitation energy.","Empirical models, Resistance ratio, Solubility of PdH and PdD at high loading, Statistical mechanics model, Tetrahedral occupation",1622_BiberianJPjcondensedp.pdf,,40.0,71.0

An analysis of the data based on an empirical solubility model based on O-site occupation allows for an understanding of the data at low temperature, but probably is not a good starting place for understanding the solubility at high temperature. We have applied a recently developed empirical model for both O-site and T-site occupation to this data set, and find good agreement between data and a basic version of the model which assumes that the O-site and T-site partition functions are taken to be harmonic oscillator partition functions. Even better agreement is obtained when a more realistic O-site partition function is used. A range of optimum models with different assumptions about the T-site partition function is considered, and it is found to be possible to select one that matches the T-site occupation at zero loading inferred from neutron diffraction measurements of Pitt and Gray (Europhys. Let. 64 (2003) 344). The O-site to T-site excitation energy is assumed independent of temperature in these models, and we obtain specific model values of 105.3 meV for a-phase PdDX and 106.5 meV for a-phase PdHX.","Empirical model, Mean-field lattice gas model, Solubility, !-phase PdHx and PdDx , Tetrahedral occupation",1623_BiberianJPjcondensedp.pdf,,72.0,95.0

We review the ideas and progress first in the area of new physical mechanisms, in which models that describe the down-conversion of the large nuclear quantum allowing for coherent energy exchange of the nuclear energy into vibrational energy. These ideas provide a connection between excess heat experiments with Pd and Ni, with D or a mixture of H and D; experiments where tritium or low-level nuclear emission is seen, and other experiments with collimated X-ray emission.

In this work we study generalizations of these models to include higher-order dependence on loading, temperature-dependent O-site energies, and also to include T-site occupation.  xperimental data sets for 10 isotherms were assembled, and augmented with additional extrapolated points for the low-pressure a-phase region as well as the high pressure ?-phase region. Loading-dependent O-site energies are optimized by minimizing the mean square error in the chemical potential between the model and data set. The resulting models give a good match to the phase diagram. If the O-site energy is allowed to be temperature dependent then the fit is better, but the resulting optimum is a mathematical optimum not so closely connected with the physical system. Models were studied in which O-site and T-site occupation occurs. When optimized these models are able to provide a good match to the phase diagram. When the O-site to T-site excitation energy is fixed according to estimates developed in earlier studies, the resulting temperature-dependent O-site energies are physically plausible. When the excitation energy are optimized together with the O-site energy, the resulting optimum is a mathematical one much less connected to the physical system. An earlier analysis of solubility in the a-phase led to a strong argument that T-site occupation occurs in palladium hydride and in palladium deuteriude; the present study supports this conclusion based on an independent data set.","Mean field model, Palladium hydride, Phase diagram, Statistical mechanics, T-site occupation",1627_BiberianJPjcondenseds.pdf,,59.0,85.0

The notion of a quantum composite is foundational to atomic, molecular, nuclear and particle physics; in our view it is also foundational to condensed matter nuclear science. It comes as a surprise that there do not appear to be review papers that discuss quantum composites. Here we consider elementary particles models, which are used to model composites; the most widely used example is that of the Dirac phenomenology for protons and neutrons. Quantum composite models can be developed from many-particle models, in some cases simply by rewriting in terms of center of mass and relative operators, and in other cases through a reduction or transformation. We have proposed models for anomalies in condensed matter nuclear science which rely heavily on the notion of a relativistic quantum composite. In the nonrelativistic case there is a clean separation of center of mass and internal degrees of freedom, so that any coupling between them must occur through external field interactions. The relativistic composite has a sizeable coupling between the center of mass motion and internal degrees of freedom, which we have proposed is responsible for the anomalies in condensed matter nuclear science. We have developed a newmodel in which the center of mass dynamics is modeled as nonrelativistic, but the internal structure is kept relativistic; this kind of model is much better adapted to problems in condensed matter nuclear science. Our approach has been strongly criticized, since in a Poincar? invariant theory the center of mass motion separates from the internal degrees of freedom in free space. We are able to rotate out the strongest part of this coupling in free space, consistent with Poincar? invariance. However, in the lattice the problem is in general much more complicated, and more powerful tools are required to diagonalize this relativistic coupling. The spin-boson type of models that we have considered previously for this are the simplest idealized models that can be diagonalized; they describe rich dynamics not present in the free-space version of the problem.","Center of mass, Foldy?Wouthuysen transformation, Phonon?nuclear coupling, Quantum composite",1628_BiberianJPjcondenseds.pdf,,144.0,230.0

In order for the X-rays to be collimated, there must either be an X-ray laser present, or else a phased-array collimation effect produced by emitting dipoles that radiate in phase. Although there have been arguments made in support of an X-ray laser origin of the effect, from our perspective this approach suffers from an absence of a plausible mechanism, short excited-state electronic lifetimes, high power requirements, and an incompatibility between the experimental geometry and the need for an elongated laser medium for beam formation. In this work we consider a model for beam formation due to many emitting dipoles randomly positioned within a circle on a mathematically flat surface. When the emitting dipole density is low, a speckle pattern is produced. Above a critical emitting dipole density beam formation occurs. The average intensity of the speckle and beam is estimated from simple statistical models at low and high dipole density, and combined to develop an empirical intensity estimate over the full range of dipole densities which compares well with numerical simulations. Beam formation occurs above a critical number of emitting dipoles, which allows us to develop an estimate for the minimum number of emitting dipoles present in the Karabut experiment. The effect of surface deformations is considered; constant offsets do not impact beam formation, and locally linear offsets direct the beam slightly off of normal. Minor displacements quadratic in the surface coordinates can produce focusing and defocusing effects, leading to a natural explanation for intense spot and line formation observed in the experiments.","Beam formation, Collimated X-ray emission, Karabut experiment, Phase coherence, Up-conversion",1629_BiberianJPjcondensedu.pdf,,58.0,78.0

Results from neutron diffraction studies at modest loading, and resistance and solubility measurements at high pressure and high loading, are used to infer O-site to T-site excitation energies and develop a smooth fit. The resulting statistical mechanics models have been optimized to provide systematic results at high loading for PdH and PdD, and also to fit the isotherms of the phase diagram of PdH.

This interaction can be rotated out in free space, but has the potential to give rise to new physics when two or more nuclei exchange phonons with a common vibrational mode. The simplest example of such a system is a homonuclear diatomic molecule in a frozen matrix, for which we are able to develop an expression for the second-order phonon?nuclear interaction that can result in a splitting of the nuclear energy levels as a result of excitation transfer between the nuclei. The phonon-nuclear coupling is an E1 interaction, so the low energy 6.237 keV E1 transition in 181Ta is special; this motivates an interest in molecular 181Ta2 as a candidate for a M?ssbauer experiment where the splitting might be observable.

We are interested in the transfer of nuclear excitation mediated by phonon exchange, which according to our theoretical approach lies at the foundation of many anomalies in Condensed Matter Nuclear Science. The transfer of excitation from one site to another involves coupling to off-resonant intermediate states with either no excitation or double excitation; as such it is a quantum mechanical effect with no classical counterpart. The indirect coupling interaction can be determined from second-order perturbation theory for an electric dipole (E1) interaction, and the resulting interaction is weak due to destructive interference. We present results for resonant phonon-mediated excitation transfer based on the relativistic phonon-nuclear boost interaction identified recently. The analysis is extended to the more complicated case of magnetic dipole (M1) interactions, where fourth-order perturbation theory is needed for the interaction. We find severe destructive interference effects very much weaken the indirect interaction in both cases. Some improvement is possible due to loss; however, the improvement seems insufficient to account for the effects seen in excitation transfer experiments in our lab. To address this issue, we propose here that shifts in the off-resonant basis state energies could lead to much larger indirect interactions. The evaluation of shifts in the basis state energies is a major project, which requires the specification of the nucleon-nucleon interaction off of resonance, and the evaluation of off-resonant binding energies; these are projects to be addressed in the future. The transverse Breit interaction is given off of resonance. The resulting indirect interaction for excitation transfer is consistent with a delocalized transfer effect, and also with cooperative (Dicke) enhancements; we expect shifts in the basis state energies to lead to new models for up-conversion and downconversion as well. Possible connections between the model and recent experimental results from excitation transfer experiments involving a 57 Co source on steel are discussed. We also consider incoherent excitation transfer, where the large excitation associated with the D2/4 He transition is transferred to highly excited unstable states in the nuclei of the host lattice. While the mechanism was proposed many years ago to account for low-level emission of energetic alphas, there has subsequently been no clarification of mechanism associated with these experiments, which provides motivation for us to consider the possibility of confirming or rejecting the mechanism through a systematic study where the ejected particle energy is determined as a function of the nuclear mass of host lattice nuclei. The argument is extended to excitation transfer from the HD/3 He transition, where few MeV alpha emission may be a candidate explanation for the observations of Storms and Scanlan, and where proton emission from 6Li may be a candidate explanation for the 0.79MeV proton signal reported by Lipinski and Lipinski.","Excitation transfer, M1 transitions, Off-resonance states, Phonon?nuclear coupling, Theory",1632_BiberianJPjcondensedz.pdf,,103.0,148.0

In an earlier study we made use of a generalization of this kind of model to include both O-site and T-site occupation to model loading in the alpha phase, loading in the beta phase, and to develop a mean field model for the phase diagram of PdHX. Here we extend the modeling to develop a model phase diagram for PdDX. Since the PdDX phase diagram is less studied that the PdHx phase diagram, the selection of isotherms is an issue, and we encountered minor technical issues in the digitization of published isotherm data. It was possible to develop good extrapolations to low loading (required for our phase diagram optimization), but we found that a reliable extrapolation of isotherms at high temperature to high loading was not possible. Consequently, after some exploration we found that ""reasonable"" global phase diagram models could be obtained with the introduction of a ""guiding"" point, where we introduce an estimate for a single pressure at high temperature and high loading to constrain the O-site energies and resulting phase diagram. This underscores the need for experimental measurements in this regime in order to understand the phase diagram. We were successful in optimizing a mean field phase diagram model for PdDX using this approach. We made use of the isotherms from our earlier modeling for PdHX to develop a new phase diagram model for PdHX making use of the same basic approach. The resulting O-site energy curves are qualitatively similar, with a somewhat deeper binding for H at high loading (attributed to the increased lattice expansion), and larger spread in O-site energies as a function of temperature (attributed to the reduced number of configurations accessible at low energy due to the larger excitation energy of the lower mass hydrogen atom).","PdD phase diagram, PdH phase diagram, mean-field statistical mechanics model, O-site and T-site occupation of H in Pd, empirical alpha-phase model for PdDX",1634_BiberianJPjcondensedzb.pdf,,410.0,424.0

Here, we consider candidates for a new laboratory experiment in which subdivision might be studied in isolation. In such an experiment, the alpha or beta decay of a radioactive source produces an initially excited nucleus, and multiple excitation transfer steps lead to two excited nuclei with lower energy excitations, such that the total excitation energy approximately matches the initial excited state energy. A suitable candidate must include an initially excited nucleus that can be produced from a commercially available radioactive source, and two final excited states in stable nuclei, where the energy mismatch is sufficiently small that it can be made up by the exchange of a few optical laser photons.

Our focus has been on the development of such a model, with recent progress reviewed. To account for excess heat production we contemplate a complicated model based on nuclear excitation transfer, subdivision and the down-conversion of keV nuclear quanta to a large number of phonons. The phonon-nuclear interaction that provides the foundation has been derived from a many-nucleon Dirac formalism, and we discuss recent efforts to confirm and improve upon the derivation. The quantification of the models under consideration require the evaluation of phonon-nuclear matrix elements, with recent progress discussed. The first step in the excess heat model involves the excitation transfer of a 24 MeV quantum associated with the D2/4He transition, which motivates a consideration of modeling and connections with experiments showing low-level energetic nuclear emissions. The analogous first step in the case of the 5.5 MeV quantum associated with the HD/3He transition is considered, where there is the possibility of low-level energetic nuclear emission, and where the issue of the availability of near-resonant energy levels can be studied. A nearby level in 137Cs is identified, which suggests a possible mechanism for the acceleration of the decay rate. We have recently revisited the issue of the null reaction, in which a D2/4He transition leads to the production of a compact D2 state from 4He, with the conclusion that this may be important in models for excess heat production and for low-level nuclear emission. Progress on subdivision is reviewed, including connections with experiments showing low-level nuclear emission, and candidates for laboratory tests. The possibility of a new 57Co/57Fe resonant excitation transfer experiment in a near single crystal sample is presented.

This has allowed us simultaneous determination of both excess heat generation and deuterium loading ratio, D/Pd, in the course of long term electrolysis which lasted for nearly two months.Dependence of excess heat generation on D/Pd has been observed up to D/Pd = 0.88 with the maximum outpuVinput ratio of 1 .35. The minimum O/Pd to produce the excess heat has been found around 0.83-0.84.Dependence of O/Pd on the overvoltage and the dependence of the excess heat generation on the O/Pd suggest that the dependence of the excess heat generation on the current density reported originally by Fleischmann and Pons and later by Storms can be interpreted in terms of the dependence of the loading ratio on the electrolysis current density.

This enables one to determine the systematic of binding energy in a much simpler way than the approach based on individual nucleons. The author developed that idea, i.e. having clusters as basic bricks within the nucleus instead of nucleons. He considered the binding energy of a particle, deuterium, tritium, 3He, and the way these spherons are bonded instead of the bonding between individual nucleons. According to that hypothesis the nuclei of the various isotopes of each element are constituted out of a particles and other nucleons grouped in order to form sub-nuclei bound together by four types of bonds called NN, NP, NNP and NPP. So, the author favored an approach trying to breakdown the binding energy value of each element isotope in the sub-values indicated above. That binding energy distribution approach in the nuclei is essential to the comprehension of LENR process.","Alpha particle, Deuterium (NP), Dineutron (NN), 3He (NPP), Tritium (NNP)",1676_BiberianJPjcondensedzd.pdf,,118.0,151.0

From the beginning, the motivation for such an extended framework was not only phenomenological, trying to address several well-known enigmatic cosmological discoveries in an alternative way: missing mass effects, universe acceleration, ... but also theoretical, and the main achievement is that indeed, it is possible to avoid most if not all generic instability issues which are well known to prevent the introduction of negative masses in General Relativity. Moreover it was also shown that such constructions are not arbitrary but can be entirely derived following the alternative mathematical choice for understanding the Time Reversal Symmetry, that of a Unitary T operator in QFT, needing a complete rehabilitation of negative energies in theoretical physics. All versions of DG theories studied so far unsurprisingly share many phenomenological outcomes, but here we shall focus on one which, for the first time, very naturally leads us to investigate the likely existence of genuine field discontinuities. The resulting phenomenology started to be explored. The first part of the article is a reminder of the main steps that led us to Dark Gravity. The second part focuses on discontinuities to show that these are all we need to explain in an unifying and very simple way many if not all of the well known so called ""LENR miracles"": Large eXcess Power (XP) not possibly of chemical origin with extremely low levels of nuclear radiations (alpha, beta, gamma, neutrons) as compared to what would be expected from nuclear processes producing the same amount of energy, Transmutations and isotopic anomalies in cold conditions, Incredible properties such as huge inertia anomalies and temperature discontinuities of a new category of objects produced in association with LENR and behaving as extremely magnetic micro ball lightnings.","Anti-gravity, Field discontinuities, Janus field, LENR, Negative energies, Time reversal",1690_BiberianJPjcondensedq.pdf,,6.0,28.0

Finally, justifications will be given for adopting a slightly modified view of the process that triggers the formation of micro lightning balls, those enigmatic objects being produced in association with (and arguably responsible for) LENR, as we have recently identified the key role being played by a local increase of the density of electrons by various  methods including a high luminosity beam (pulse) of electrons on a target.","Anti-gravity, Field discontinuities, Janus field, LENR, Negative energies, Time reversal",1691_BiberianJPjcondensedt.pdf,,64.0,85.0

In their experiment, D2  gas permeates through a Pd complexes, which consists of a thin Pd layer, alternating CaO and Pd layers and bulk Pd. When they used sample Pd complexes with additional Cs on the surface, Pr emerged on the surface while Cs decreased after the sample was subjected to D2  gas permeation at 343 K and 1 atm for about one week. The elemental analysis was performed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). This phenomenon was reproduced qualitatively in the present replication experiment.We performed D-permeation experiments similar to the MHI?s experiment three times, and we confirmed the production of Pr. Pd complex samples were provided to us by MHI. The surface was electrolytically cleaned to remove hydrocarbons before depositing Cs. D2  gas was permeated through the Pd complexes at 343 K and 1 atm for about 5 days. Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) was performed to analyze the existence of the elements (Cs and Pr) and the mass distribution. The results showed the existence of Pr. And we also confirmed the existence of Pr by using fast Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) in Fusion Neutronics Source (FNS) of Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI).As a result, we confirmed that the nuclear transmutation reaction, from 133Cs to 141Pr, was occurred. This transmutation suggests that the mass numbers and atomic numbers increase 8 and 4, respectively. The model of multi-body resonance fusion of deuterons proposed by A. Takahashi2 can explain this mass-8-and-charge-4 increased transmutation.",transmutation,1697_Higashiyamreplicatio.pdf,,,

For both nano-Pd materials, the absorption capacity at 1MPa was found to be slightly smaller than that of Pd bulk. The difference in the absorption capacity between hydrogen and deuterium, i.e., the isotope effect, was negligible within the experimental error. It was found that the average size of the Pd particles was significantly increased after the repeated measurements of the absorption capacity. The heat generated upon pressurizing the materials with deuterium or hydrogen up to 1MPa was measured using a flow calorimeter. Similar to the measurements of absorption capacity, the heat measurements were also conducted repeatedly. The observed heat generation was composed of two stages, i.e., the first stage during pressurizing the samples from 0 to 1 MPa and the second stage, where the sample was kept under a fixed pressure of 1 MPa. The heat generated in the first stage was much larger at the time of the first measurement than at the second or third. The heat generated in the first stage was largely explained by taking into account two chemical reactions, i.e., the water formation reaction and the deuteride formation reaction. It was noted that in the second stage, where the heat generated from chemical reactions was hardly expected to occur, a small heat power was observed intermittently.

It has been demonstrated that the surface segregation of S from the interior of Pd bulk during the permeation process causes a significant lowering of permeation rate with increasing permeation time, although the concentration of S impurity in Pd bulk is probably less than 10 ppm. The surface accumulated S during D2 permeation also gives rise to a difficulty in detecting small amount of elements on the surface of Pd after deuterium permeation treatment. For selected nuclear transmutation from Sr to Mo reported by Iwamura group, we have successfully observed Mo on the surface of Sr ion-implanted Pd after a deuterium permeation treatment, by adding a process that removes the sulfur accumulated on the surface of the Pd foil. A time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS) study on the origin of the observed Mo will be described in a separate paper.","Deuterium permeation, Pd metal, Poisoning, S impurity, Transmutation, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy",1705_BiberianJPjcondensede.pdf,,73.0,85.0

The resulting nuclides with atomic numbers Z are spread over the whole table of the periodic system. Based on our models of having the protons as an exotic plasma whose most energetic tail of about 1 to 2 eV reacts within about 2 pm distance where the Coulomb repulsion is reduced by screening, especially in the swimming electron layer, we derive a relation to the magic numbers of the nuclear shell model from the measured Z-dependence of the reaction probabilities. This agreement with the magic numbers is an excellent proof of consistency for the measurements.

For a more historic view, the motivation for the Fleischmann-Pons experiment or the Preparata effect were well explained while-as an unusual view-L. Case reported that experiments may be understood by a simple chemical process involving catalytic surface properties. This could also explain why heat production happens in some cases and not in other cases. Contrary to this is the history of the observation of neutron emission from palladium compounds [1] or from deuterated palladium [2] that indicate nuclear processes. Today we have the significant result of Tian, Li et al [3] that the reaction of palladium wires after reacting with a hydrogen atmosphere during a current discharge, when the energy input was stopped and the gas evacuated, generated ""heat after dead"" for 43 hours producing about 3.6kW/cm^3 or 13 keV/atom Pd . . .","theory, review, ICCF-9",1733_HoraHsummaryabo.pdf,,,

Conversion of deuterium to tritium in palladium has been clearly confirmed by the Arata-Zhang experiments. Endothermic element synthesis in Pd. and/or Ni layers due to high proton concentration, in analogy to stellar synthesis can be seen from the generation of very rare elements such as terbium. A convincing explanation is necessary. It was concluded phenomenologically that the reaction of the protons or deuterons by fusion or with the nuclei of the host metal occurs at a distance of about picometers with a reaction time of about megaseconds. It was noted that the Bohr radius rB of hydrogen atoms in a dielectric with refractive index n is changed to rBn2. such that with the electron concentration of the host metals a plasma refractive index of 0.076 results in a value of 3pm. In order to understand the subsequent dielectric modification of the ionization energy, we apply the model of depression of this energy by the Inglis-Teller effect for which a model with the best agreement with plasma experiments was presented before. For our model of the dielectrically shrunk picometer hydrogen atoms, the low ionization energies result in a reasonable relation between dielectric properties and the effective Debye length. Preference of the reaction at surfaces or interfaces between different host metals are due to the same reduction of the dielectric response as observed with surface plasmons. For the swimming electron layer theory, the spreading of the double layer for metal interfaces was discussed.","ICCF-9, theory, swimming electron",1734_HoraHshrinkingo.pdf,,,

Some reflections to Rutherford?s discovery of nuclear physics, the Cockroft-Oliphant discovery of anomalous low energy fusion reactions and the chemist Hahn?s discovery of fission had to be included. Using gaseous atmosphere or discharges between palladium targets, rather significant results were seen e.g. from the ""life after death"" heat production of such high values per host atom that only nuclear reactions can be involved. This supports the earlier evaluation of neutron generation in fully reversible experiments with gas discharges hinting that a reasonable screening effect - preferably in the swimming electron layer - may lead to reactions at nuclear distances d of picometers with reaction probability times U of about megaseconds similar to the K-shell capture radioactivity. Further electrolytic experiments led to Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR) where the involvement of pollution could be excluded from the appearance of very seldom rare earth elements. A basically new theory for DD cross sections is used to confirm the picometer-megasecond reactions of cold fusion. Other theoretical aspects are given from measured heavy element distributions similar to the standard abundance distribution, SAD, in the Universe with consequences on endothermic heavy nuclei generation, magic numbers and to quark-gluon plasmas.",theory,1735_HoraHlowenergyna.pdf,,,

Fusion Energy,26,http://lenr-canr.org/acrobat/HoraHmaruhngrei.pdf,2013-08-29,One of the most convincing facts about LENR due to deuterons of very high concentration in host metals as palladium is the measurement of the large scale minimum of the reaction probability depending on the nucleon number A of generated elements at A = 153 where a local maximum was measured. This is similar to the fission of uranium at A = 119 where the local maximum follows from the Maruhn-Greiner theory if the splitting nuclei are excited to about MeV energy. The LENR generated elements can be documented any time after the reaction by SIMS or K-shell X-ray excitation to show the very unique distribution with the local maximum. An explanation is based on the strong Debye screening of the Maxwellian deuterons within the degenerate rigid electron background especially within the swimming electron layer at the metal surface or at interfaces. The deuterons behave like neutrals at distances of about 2 picometers. They may form clusters due to soft attraction in the range above thermal energy. Clusters of 10 pm diameter may react over long time probabilities (megaseconds) with Pd nuclei leading to a double magic number compound nucleus which splits like in fission to the A = 153 element distribution.,"Fission of excited nuclei  Low energy nuclear reactions in metals  Compound nuclei  Coulomb screening by small Debye length  Swimming electron layer, Pd, Coehn, heat+, D2 O, electrolysis, resistivity, loading, ICCF-8",1736_HoraHmaruhngrei.pdf,,,

A similarity is discussed for the low energy nuclear reactions (LENR) being proved from analogies of measurements of uranium fission. The distribution of the elements with uranium fission is similar to the element distribution with LENR. This was observed repeatedly and reproducibly with high density deuteron concentration in palladium. This discussion is specifically focussed to the Maruhn-Greiner local maximum of the distribution within the large-scale minimum if the fission nuclei are excited. The consequences of the complications in uranium fission are discussed in comparison with LENR with respect to the studies of a hypothetical fissioning compound nuclear reaction via a concluded element 306X126 with double magic numbers.,theory,1737_HoraHradiochemi.pdf,,,

This permits then the description of the inverted state of Rydberg matter in agreement with the recent measurements of Holmlid et al. for deuterium clusters with ultra-high deuteron densities in the range of 1029cm-3.

The hot refrigerant vapor from the freon compressor is used to heat the water flowing through a tiny passage of a triple-pipe heat exchanger (THX). This can cause a violent cavitation of water and two-phase flow instabilities, and produce excess energy. The VCS machine was further modified and tested for two years since then. We improved the calorimetry in measuring COP. From the energy balance of THX, we defined COP as the net heat output from water divided by the net heat input to THX, which is denoted as COPx. If the measured COPx was greater than 1, we can confirm the occurrence of excess energy generation or the low energy nuclear reaction (LENR). The test results show that the maximum COPx reaches 2.39 and COPx increases with decreasing inlet water temperature. We observed some peculiar phenomena. The output refrigerant vapor from the compressor is, instead, heated by water at some part of the heat exchanger. In addition, abnormally-high water line pressure damaged the pressure gauge, and also caused crack and leakage of the copper pipe. We also observed severe buckling and black appearance of the middle pipe. The buckling may result from a huge exerted pressure around 740 bar which is far beyond the system operating pressure. This may be caused by LENR. We also made another machine (DHX-1) using a double-pipe heat exchanger heated by a steam boiler. The maximum COPx reaches 2.55 and some peculiar phenomena similar to the VCS machine was observed. The inner copper pipe was deformed by buckling and the outer pipe wall was cracked and leaked. This may be caused by huge pressure (>225 bar) or a high temperature (>500?C) which results in buckling and rupture of the pipes. The surface of the ruptured inner pipe becomes shining black and looks like CuO nanowires produced by thermal oxidation of copper. The chemical element of the ruptured copper pipe increases by 3 to 4 folds in C, 10 folds in O, and 1.4 to 4.4 folds in Fe. Replacing the identical brand-new double-pipe heat exchanger (DHX-1B), we obtained the same results as DHX-1 with COPx > 2.0, inner pipe rupture and blackening, and chemical element change. COPx > 2.0 also occurred in a new heat exchanger (DHX-2) made from stronger copper tubes with a larger size. All of these excess-energy phenomena in VCS and DHX are probably induced by LENR. In the present study, we experimentally confirm that excess energy or LENR can be induced by a heat transfer process involving cavitation in heat-exchange systems. The excess energy process has been shown reproduceable and controllable.","Excess energy, low-energy nuclear reaction, LENR, cavitation, cavitation-induced LENR",1749_BiberianJPjcondensedzi.pdf,,257.0,275.0

In Ken Shoulders words, EVO?s are, ""Highly organized, micron-sized clusters of electrons, having soliton behavior, with electron populations density on the order of Avogadro?s number per cm3 (A typical 2?m EVO has a population of 1011 to 1013 electrons). When interacted with solid material, these charge clusters perform a low-energy phase transformation type of atomic disruption that liquefies the lattice and propels the material to a high velocity without apparent signs of conventional heating. Using an ordinary thermal interpretation, a thermal gradient for bulk material greater than 26,000 degrees C per micrometer would be required to achieve these effects"". This paper presents lessons from thin film deposition methods like Vacuum Arc, Pulsed Electron beam, Pulsed Laser whose commonality with EVO generation is pulse energy impingement on a target. Rather than the hypothesis of a ""new form of matter"" as an explanation of EVO?s, it is hypothesized that generation of a micro shaped-charge, in analogy with explosively formed shaped-charge munitions, can explain the characteristics of surfaces that were struck by EVO?s. This hypothesis reproduces the effects that are underlined in the text above.",,1759_BiberianJPjcondensedzi.pdf,,40.0,47.0

These include experimental evidence for very high virtual pressures under certain conditions, and the influence of promotors and surface blockers. Dislocation generation and motion can result from the large stresses accompanying composition gradients and phase transformations. Because of preferential segregation of interstitial species to dislocations, transport along dislocations can be much faster than through the bulk crystal, and dislocation motion can cause unusually rapid interstitial solute transport and both entry and emission from surfaces. Mechanical effects related to the presence of hydrogen often are sporadic and can have long delay times. It is possible that some of the same microstructural features and phenomena that are responsible for delayed mechanical behavior play an important role in the ""solid state fusion"" observations. Two dislocation mechanisms are presented that can produce transient local hyperloading.","Pd, H, review, loading, electrolysis, dislocation, ICCF-4",1764_HugginsRAmaterialsa.pdf,,,

Mechanisms that are involved in the loss of capacity upon the cycling of electro?chemical cells are discussed. The inherent instability of the electrochemical interface and the resul?tant geometrical changes are characteristic of electrodes in which the reactant is a pure element. On the other hand, decrepitation can play an important role in the case of polyphase electrodes in which significant changes in specific volume occur. A simple one-dimensional model is presented that shows the mechanism and the important parameters that are involved in particle fracture.

The measurements of the reactions 2H(d,p)3H and 2H(d,n)3He were performed with an electrostatic accelerator at incident deuteron energies between 5 and 60keV at different self-implanted target materials. The resulting screening energy values are about one order of magnitude larger compared to gas target experiments and exceed significantly the theoretical predictions. A thorough investigation of the processes in the targets under ion irradiation shows that there are multi-parameter collateral effects which are crucial for the correct interpretation of the observed enhancements. They mainly originate from target surface contaminations due to residual gases in the vacuum as well as from inhomogeneities in the deuteron density distribution in heterogeneous targets. For the special situation of deuterium in the metallic environment an improved analysis method has been developed beyond the standard procedures. Experimental evidence for the influence of such effects and a mathematical model for their assessment are given and compared with the results of other groups.

However, the resulting screening energies differ strongly for diverse host metals and different experiments. Here, we present new experimental results and investigations of interfering processes in the irradiated targets. These measurements inside metals set special challenges and pitfalls that make them and the data analysis particularly error prone. There are multiparameter collateral effects that are crucial for the correct interpretation of the observed experimental yields. They mainly originate from target surface contaminations owing to residual gases in the vacuum as well as from inhomogeneities and instabilities in the deuteron density distribution in the targets. To address these problems an improved differential analysis method beyond the standard procedures has been implemented. Profound scrutiny of the other experiments demonstrates that the observed unusual changes in the reaction yields are mainly due to deuteron density dynamics simulating the alleged screening energy values. The experimental results are compared with different theoretical models of the electron screening in metals. The Debye-H?ckel model that has been previously proposed to explain the influence of the electron screening on both nuclear reactions and radioactive decays can be clearly excluded.","ion-bombardment, d-d, cross section",1772_HukeAenhancemen.pdf,,,

Hydrogen ions are implanted directly from nonthermal discharge plasma or ion source into a surface of liquid Li metal at a buffer energy of a few tens keV where nuclear stopping occurs. The ions interact with Li atoms or mixed element atoms which are not being internally excited and tend towards the formation of united atoms at the minimum Gibbs free energy point. This leads to the enhanced rate of non-thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen ions due to cohesion in the liquid metal.","ionbombardment, Li, D, cross-section",1798_IkegamiHbufferener.pdf,,,

In the electrolysis experiment, upper gas of the electrolysis cell was analyzed using a Quadrupole Mass Analysis System (Q-MAS). Significant amount of helium-4 was detected without neutron emission in several experiments and in one of these experiments, the amount of helium-4 atom in the released gas from the palladium cathode was 8.1 x 10^16 atoms. Under electron beam irradiation to highly D-loaded palladium, anomalous spectra were taken in X-ray measurement. In the experiments using deuteron beam and TiDx, responses which suggested 3D multi-body fusion were taken and the reaction rate of which was increased compared to the D(d,p)T reaction rate, below 100 keV. This result may reflect the coherent effect of the solid state in the reactions. From the results of the experiments using proton beam and TiDx, peaks which suggested 3D multi-body reaction were detected with high reproducibility. Moreover, high energetic protons having 17-20 MeV emitted kinetic energy which suggested H-D-D three-body coherent fusion were also detected.","Pd, D2O, electrolysis, heat+, ion bombardment, Ti, particle emission, 3 body, He, neutron, X-ray, ICCF-8",1815_IsobeYsearchforc.pdf,,,

A meaningful increase of helium-4 was observed during electrolysis with the Pd-D2O system, while neutron emission was not observed. The D+D+D fusion, 3D→t+3He+9.5 MeV, has been observed repeatedly in deuteron-beam irradiation experiments with a TiDx target. On the other hand, in proton-beam experiments with TiDx, H+D+D-fusion: H+D+D→p+4He+23.8 MeV was observed. Considering this result, it seems that the 3D reaction occurred between two deuterons trapped closely in TiDx and an incident particle of deuteron. . . .","Experiment electrolysis, ion beam, Pd Ti D2O 4He+ thin film neutron heat multibody ion bombardment three body fusion",1816_IsobeYsearchform.pdf,,,

Following Mizuno?s procedures, we fabricated nano-structured material composed of Pd and Ni by glow discharge on a heater located in the center of a vacuum chamber. The nano-structured Pd/Ni was prepared with D2 before use. Then, we applied electrical power to the heater that was covered with the nano-structured Pd/Ni while evacuating the chamber, and we observed the heater temperature behavior. Next, we introduced D2 gas at about 250 Pa to the chamber while maintaining the heater input. As a result, in three experiments, we observed that heater temperature increases compared to the reference experiment (with no nano-structured Pd/Ni). In particular, in experiments with 7 W input, we observed a123?C heater temperature increase compared to the reference experiment. It can be said that we replicated Mizuno?s experiment successfully. Since the heater was covered with nano-structured material, there was a concern that a change in emissivity affected the heater temperature measurement. Numerical calculation was conducted to evaluate the effect of the change of the surface emissivity. It was concluded that even if the emissivity drop dramatically from 0.7 to 0.3 due to the coating of the nano-structured Pd/Ni, the temperature rise would be only 70?C at the most. The postulated emissivity change cannot explain the observed temperature increase of 123?C. These experimental and numerical results suggest that anomalous excess heat was generated by the interaction between nano-structured Pd/Ni surface and D2 gas.","Anomalous heat, D2 gas absorption, Finite element method, Nano-structured material, Replication",1820_BiberianJPjcondensedw.pdf,,191.0,202.0

Using the new system, we attempted to measure the radiation from the sample when a heat burst occurred while anomalous excess heat was being continuously generated. About 10 big burst events were observed during the 5-day continuous measurement: it was found that the radiation intensity increased simultaneously as the heater temperature suddenly increased. We have made a comparison of the radiant spectrum of the burst event with the spectrum in normal times. There is no particular difference due to the burst; both spectra can be simply interpreted as grey body radiation emitted from a thermally equilibrated object. The correlation of radiant intensity between near-IR and visible light has been deduced; although it is expected there is a linear correlation between them, two correlation lines can be drawn instead of one. This indicates that the contribution of photon emission from the non-equilibrium stage may have an effect.","Excess heat, Anomalous heat, Heat burst, Multilayer thin film, Nano-sized metal composite, Nano material, Hydrogen gas, Gas loading, Optical observation",1821_BiberianJPjcondensedzi.pdf,,284.0,294.0

Two nano-sized metal multilayer composite samples, which were composed of Ni, Cu, CaO, Y2O3 thin films on bulk Ni (25 mm ? 25 mm ? 0.1 mm), were placed in a vacuum chamber. These samples were fabricated by Ar ion beam sputtering method. After baking of the samples, H2 gas was introduced into the chamber up to about 230 Pa at 250 deg C. Then, the Ni based multilayer thin films started to absorb H2 gas. Amount of absorbed H2 gas can be evaluated by the pressure measurement of the chamber. Typically, after about 50,000 s, H2 gas was evacuated and simultaneously the samples were heated up by the ceramic heater up to 500?900 deg C. The evacuation and heating process seem to trigger heat generation reactions. Heat burst phenomena were simultaneously detected by a radiation thermometer looking at the surface of the multilayer thin film and a thermocouple located near the metal composite. It shows that heat measurement by the thermocouple embedded in the ceramic heater correctly reflects surface temperature detected by the radiation thermometer. Excess energy generation using nano-sized multilayer Cu/Ni metal composite and Cu/Ni metal with third material (CaO, Y2O3) composite were presented. Maximum released excess energy reached 1.1 MJ and average released energy per absorbed total hydrogen was 16 keV/H or 1.5 GJ/H-mol. It cannot be explained by any known chemical process and suggests that the observed heat generation must be of nuclear origin. Various analysis methods, such as SEM-EDX or TOF-SIMS, had been applied to obtain information about what kind of reactions occur by the interaction of the nano-sized multilayer metal composite with hydrogen gas.","Anomalous heat, Excess heat, Gas loading, Heat burst, Hydrogen gas, Multilayer thin film, Nano material, Nano-sized metal composite",1846_BiberianJPjcondensedzf.pdf,,7.0,19.0

In this paper, we will first give a short overview of the progress in these gas loading type experiments. After that, we will describe the recent progress of our research team. The authors have been studying energy generation using nano-sized multilayer metal composites with hydrogen gas. Two nano-sized metal multilayer composite samples, which were composed of Ni, Cu, and other thin films on bulk Ni (25 mm ? 25 mm ? 0.1 mm), were used. These samples were fabricated by the Ar ion beam method, or by the magnetron sputtering method. Heat bursts and excess energy generation were observed during the experiments under vacuum conditions (<10^-4 Pa) using nano-sized metal multilayer composites on Ni substrate and hydrogen gas. Released energy normalized to the total amount of absorbed hydrogen reached 16 keV/H or 1.5 GJ/H-mol. Sometimes spontaneous heat bursts were observed. This suggests that the burst heat release reactions occurred in the near surface region of the nano-sized multilayer metal composite. Furthermore, we have succeeded in intentionally inducing heat bursts, based on the observations of the spontaneous heat bursts. By measuring the optical spectrum emitted from the sample, we detected a simultaneous increase in mid infrared radiation flux when a heat burst occurred.","Excess heat, Anomalous heat, Heat burst, Multilayer thin film, Nano-sized metal composite, Nano material, Hydrogen gas, Gas loading, Optical observation",1847_BiberianJPjcondensedzi.pdf,,295.0,311.0

The neutron counting rate, averaged over a 5 minute interval, was a couple of orders of magnitude larger than that of background count rates. In this experiment the tritium level in the D2O electrolyte jumped from the initial stock solution value of 2.6 Bq/ml to a 5.6 ? 10^4 Bq/ml, an increase by over four orders of magnitude. The total quantity of tritium generated corresponds to ≈ 10^16 atoms suggesting a neutron to tritium channel branching ratio of less than 10^-8 in cold fusion. Significant quantities of neutrons and tritium were also observed to be produced in gas loaded Ti and Pd samples. Autoradiography of D2  loaded Ti disc targets have shown a number of hot spots indicating uneven distribution of tritium production in the near-surface region.

The experiments were primarily devoted to the study of the emission of nuclear particles such as neutrons and tritium with a view to verify the ""nuclear origin"" of cold fusion. In 22 different electrolytic experiments whose cathode surface areas ranged from 0.1 to 300 cm^2, large bursts of neutrons and/or tritium were measured. Some of these gave clear evidence that these two nuclear particles were being generated simultaneously. The neutron-to-tritium yield ratios in the majority of these experiments was in the range of 10^-6 to 10^-9. The specific neutron and tritium yields expressed per cm^2 of cathode surface area also fitted into a systematic pattern.

In this mechanism the process is initiated by an external photon whose contribution is treated perturbatively. In the present paper we consider a related process that is induced by photon emission rather than absorption. We consider, as an example, fusion of hydrogen and deuterium to form He(3). This process, at leading order, proceeds by emission of a photon. In the present case we consider two photon emission and hence we need to go to the second order in perturbation theory. The emission of a high energy photon from the initial D-H system leads to the formation of an intermediate state which is a superposition of all energy eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian. We compute the cross section for such a reaction and show that, for suitable conditions in condensed matter medium, the reaction rate can be sufficiently large to be observable..","Nuclear reactions, nuclear fusion, nuclear electromagnetic transitions",1860_BiberianJPjcondensedzh.pdf,,7.0,26.0

The initial two body nuclear state emits a photon and forms an intermediate state which makes a transition into the final nuclear state with the emission of another photon. We need to sum over all energies of the intermediate state. Since the energy of this state is unconstrained, we get contributions from very high energies for which the barrier penetration factor is not necessarily small. By considering fusion of 1H and 2H to form 3He, we determine the conditions under which this mechanism leads to fusion at observable rates. We show that this mechanism works only inside a medium and not in free space. We show that a clear experimental signature of this process is emission of two photons in coincidence whose total energy is related to the Q value of this process. Hence this process can be confirmed or ruled by the presence or absence of such photons in the final state.",,1861_BiberianJPjcondensedzi.pdf,,312.0,314.0

Sci.,33,http://lenr-canr.org/acrobat/BiberianJPjcondensedzf.pdf#page=174,2020-08-26,"Researchers have long been puzzled about the basic nuclear reaction mechanisms of low-energy nuclear reactions (LENR). Usually the crystal lattice or nano-particles (among others) are assumed to be the nuclear active environment that catalyzes the reaction somehow. In contrast, the author has built a quantum-mechanical model of the nuclear active environment in LENR, where this environment is modeled as an ultra-dense plasmoid, i.e. a ""condensed plasmoid"" (CP). The computed properties of CPs are so exotic that CPs qualify as a previously unknown aggregation state of matter. The quantum-mechanical model of CPs is based on the cylindrical symmetry of a very thin (i.e. about 40 pm) plasma ""wire"". (The quantitative properties given in the abstract depend on the configuration of the CP; these are just examples.) The electrons of a CP are fully delocalized and decoupled from the nuclei. They are moving with high velocity (10?80% of light speed) against the nuclei. This results in an intrinsic current of about 9 kA in the CP with a mean current density of approximately 2.5 A/pm2. The magnetic field from this current reaches 50 MT (magatesla) and creates a confinement pressure of more than 1021 Pa. The electrons are compressed by the strong z-pinch condition to a mean density of about 0.15 electrons/pm3. The creation of a CP is an endothermic process (i.e. it takes in energy from an external source), which typically requires discharges with high voltages and high currents. Once created, these objects can be long-living (lasting hours). The minimum distance of hydrogen nuclei in a CP is only about 2 pm, which enables tunneling of nuclei through the Coulomb barrier, i.e. nuclear fusion. The barrier is also much screened by the dense electrons.","Charge clusters, EVs, EVOs, LENR, Nuclear active environment, Pease-?Braginskii current, Plasmoids, Rradiative collapse, Strange radiation, z-Pinch",1862_BiberianJPjcondensedzf.pdf,,174.0,199.0

This paper presents the observation of 3H and mantle helium in the crater Lakes Nemrut (Turkey), Laacher (Germany) and Pavin (France). The presence of excess 3H in the lakes can be explained as material released from mantle sources because of the correlation of excess 3H with mantle 3He and 4He. The helium concentration was much higher in the bottom layers of the lakes. The 4He and 3He concentrations in Lakes Nemrut, Laacher, and Pavin were determined to be 25 and 190; 10 and 50; and 70 and 500 times larger than the atmospheric saturation value, respectively.

Encouraged by this new idea, we tried to recreate nuclear fusion at low temperature in the laboratory. This paper describes charged particles emitted from the deuterium-loaded titanium foil and powder at low temperature. Although the counts are very low (about 0.13 counts/h), fortunately, broad and narrow peaks are observed for the deuterium-loaded titanium foil and TiD-Mo sample respectively. The charged particle is identified as proton having energy of about 2.8 MeV after exiting the sample. We suggest that the proton might originate from d‑d reaction in the samples. Then the d-d reaction rate is calculated to be 1.4 ? 10^-24 fusion/d-d?sec for the deuterium-loaded titanium foil sample. On the other hand, no charged particles were observed above the background level for deuterium-loaded titanium powder sample. Therefore, this work provides a positive result of nuclear fusion for the metal foil samples, but a negative result for the powder samples. The negative result of the deuterium-loaded titanium powder sample suggests that the reaction yield might be correlated with deuterium density, or it may be correlated with microscopic variations in the deuterium-loaded titanium materials. The negative result also indicates that d-d reaction catalyzed by ?-meson from cosmic ray can be excluded in this experiment.

We present evidence for energetic charged particles emanating from partially-deuterided titanium foils (TiDx) subjected to non-equilibrium conditions. To scrutinize emerging evidence for low-temperature nuclear reactions, we investigated particle yields employing three independent types of highly-sensitive, segmented particle detectors over a six-year period.? One experiment measuring neutron emission from TiDx foils showed a background-subtracted yield of 57 ? 13 counts per hour.? (The neutron experiments will be discussed in a separate paper.)? A second experiment, using a photo-multiplier tube with plastic and glass scintillators and TiDx registered charged particle emissions at 2,171 ? 93 counts/hour, over 400 times the background rate.?? Moreover, these particles were identified as protons having 2.6 MeV after ex-iting the TiDx foil array.? In a third experiment, coincident charged particles consistent with protons and tritons were observed with high reproducibility in two energy-dispersive ion-implanted detectors located on either side of 25-micron thick Ti foils loaded with deuterium.? Our overall data therefore strongly sug-gest low-level nuclear fusion in deuterided metals under these conditions according to the fusion reactions d + d ? n(2.45 MeV) + 3He(0.82 MeV)? and? d + d ? p(3.02 MeV) + t(1.01 MeV), with other nuclear reactions being possible also.? Important advances were particle identifications, and repeatability exceed-ing 70% for coincident charged particle emissions. Metal processing and establishing non-equilibrium conditions appear to be important keys to achieving significant nuclear-particle yields and repeatability.","charged particle, titanium",1922_JonesSEchargedpar.pdf,,,

General expressions of the cross section of the processes are reported in the case of one particle nuclear and spherical shell models as well as in the case of free atoms (e.g. noble gases). A half-life characteristic of the process is also determined. As numerical examples, the cooperative internal conversion process by neutron exchange in Ne and by proton exchange in Al are dealt with. The processes may have significance in fields of nuclear waste disposal and nuclear energy production. As a generalization, cooperative internal conversion process by heavy charged particle exchange is discussed, and as an example of it, the cooperative internal conversion process by triton exchange is also discussed.","Internal conversion and extranuclear effects, Other topics of nuclear reactions: speci?c reactions, Other topics in nuclear engineering and nuclear power studies, Radioactive wastes, Waste disposal",1950_BiberianJPjcondensedx.pdf,,135.0,147.0

It is shown that this hindering effect may be essentially weakened (it practically disappears) if one takes into account the Coulomb interaction of one of the reacting particles with the surroundings. It is obtained that if the modification of the wave function due to Coulomb interaction with charged constituents of the environment is taken into account applying standard perturbation calculation of quantum mechanics then waves of high momentum with small amplitude are mixed to the initial wave of small momentum. This may be interpreted as the slow, quasi-free heavy particle of positive charge pushes a heavy particle of the environment and they can obtain (virtually) such a great magnitude of momentum (of opposite direction) in the intermediate state in that the probability of nuclear reaction with another positively charged, slow, heavy particle significantly increases. This magnitude of (virtual) momentum is determined by energy and momentum conservation between initial and final states. The mechanism (called recoil assistance) opens the door to a great variety of nuclear processes that are now thought to have negligible rate at low energies. The recoil assisted nuclear $pd$ reaction is investigated like a sample reaction numerically. A partial overview of low energy nuclear reactions allowed by recoil assistance and leading to nuclear transmutations is presented. A critical analysis of Fleischmann-Pons type low energy nuclear reaction experiments is also presented.","Fusion and fusion??ssion reactions, 2H-induced nuclear reactions, Nucleon induced reactions",1951_BiberianJPjcondensedx.pdf,,148.0,164.0

A series of concepts, which were raised and partly elaborated, are presented. The key concept is a three-body mechanism, where one of the nuclei serves as a catalyst for the reaction of the other two. In these reactions, a single fusion product or two outgoing nuclei are created, along with the recoiled catalytic nucleus. They carry off the nuclear energy released, and heat the surrounding materials by multiple collisions. Importantly, they produce high energy ! radiation with negligible probability. So, this three-body idea solves the two major riddles of LENR, that nuclear reactions can occur at ordinary temperatures and without emitting ! radiation. Cross sections and rates are calculated using standard quantum mechanics, and accepted nuclear and solid-state physics. Their dependence on relevant densities, and on the reacting and catalytic nuclei, are explicit. The theoretical ideas and the results of their elaboration are compared with diverse data from LENR experiments with considerable success.",Nuclear reactions; Specific reactions; General; Quantum mechanics; Fusion reactions,1952_BiberianJPjcondensedzg.pdf,,65.0,102.0

In most experiments the correlation of the relative output Excess Heat power to the input (electric) power does not exceed 10-20%. This scientific approach is now well recognized by the leading groups of researchers and scientific associations (such as the American Physical Society, the American Nuclear Society, the Los Alamos US National Laboratory, the US Livermore Lawrence National Laboratory and others.) despite the lack of widely familiar theoretical instrument for the description of the physical phenomena in question.",glow diacharge,1989_KarabutABscientific.pdf,,,

In the present work, results so far obtained in low-energy beam experiments will be overviewed and the origin of the screening potential will be discussed: both electronic screening and ionic screening. For ionic screening we have studied nuclear reactions in liquid metal which can be regarded as a low-temperature dense plasma. In such a condition, the classical ions contribute to the screening more strongly than the quantum electrons do. Results on the 7Li+p and 6Li+d reactions with liquid Li target will be shown.

It is found that the reaction mechanism is unique to the molecular beam in such a way that one deuteron in a molecule is elastically scattered by a host metal atom and then it collides with the other to cause the d+d reaction. We call it as the cooperative colliding mechanism (CCM). Experimental data are compared with the CCM calculation and values of the screening energy of the d+d reaction are deduced.

A survey of the literature indicates that palladium particles less than 2 nm in size can obtain a Pd/D loading near one at modest deuterium pressure. In hundreds of reactions, we have routinely prepared palladium nanoparticles inside an aluminosilicate matrix and have found that these systems produce up to 8 fold more heat with deuterium compared to hydrogen. Furthermore, a characteristic signature of a pressurization reaction is its reversibility -- the heat released upon pressurization should be absorbed upon evacuation. This reversibility is observed with hydrogen but not deuterium. Although we are still seeking conventional explanations for this excess heat, the anomalous heat does not appear to be explained by impurities in the deuterium gas nor other simple chemical or physical sources. The selection and preparation of the particles, the experimental set-up, and results will be discussed.",Excess heat,2039_KidwellDdoesgasloa.pdf,,,

This heat is produced in the presence of deuterium but not in the presence of hydrogen. Control experiments have ruled out the excess heat was due to impurities in the deuterium that were absent in the hydrogen. Because the system is simple and mostly reversible, all extra heat must be of chemical or some other origin. Neither radiation nor nuclear ""ash"" was found to correlate with the anomalous heat. In some matrices, the likely source of the anomalous heat is D-H exchange with the water present in the matrix, where an approximate third increase of the expected energy from  calculations can account for most of the excess heat. In other matrices, no simple explanation of the excess heat can be made.",,2040_ViolanteVproceeding.pdf,,144.0,153.0

We also have been unable to observe long-term heat in the commercial materials and materials prepared at NRL. Furthermore, when tested using our gas-loading protocol of measuring both the heat during pressurization and evacuation, these alloys do not show much, if any, excess heat and the majority of the heat observed can be attributed to chemistry.","Excess heat, Gas loading, LENR, Melt-spinning, Nanoparticles",2041_BiberianJPjcondensedg.pdf,,214.0,224.0

Thin film electrode production and characterization for heat cell studies are described. The objective is two-fold: maximizing excess heat production and insuring a long lifetime and electrolysis. To do this in a reproducible faction, a pre-and post-run analysis of the films was carried out using various probe techniques. In this study, various Pd-Ni thin films were manufactured using with a magnetron sputtering method. A variety of methods for pre-conditioning of substrates were experimented with. The samples were also treated by different annealing methods using inert gas and vacuum annealing processes. The investigations of samples were performed in an UHV system equipped with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). It is shown that the vacuum annealed samples provided the best films. This suggests that vacuum annealing can pull bubbles from pores in the thin film, giving a higher density thin film that performs better. These results and their implications for electrode development will be discussed.","ICCF-9, film, method, layer, Pd-Ni",2045_KimSOcharacteri.pdf,,,

Another mechanism for the Gamow factor cancellation is a continuum-electron shielding of nuclear charge by a dense electron plasma. If the Gamow factor cancellation occurs, it can lead to a large enhancement of reaction rates and probabilities for low-energy nuclear fusion reaction and nuclear fission, and may provide nuclear physics mechanisms for explaining the anomalous effects observed in low-energy nuclear reactions.

Some of the reported results have been interpreted as a result of achieving thermonuclear fusion temperatures (~a few keV) during acoustic bubble cavitation (ABC).? We propose an alternative theoretical model for the ABC fusion based on Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) mechanism. Our theoretical model yields two main predictions.? The first prediction is that the Coulomb interaction between two charged bosons is suppressed for the case in which number N of charged bosons is large, and hence the conventional Gamow factor is absent. The second prediction is that the fusion rate depends on the probability of the BEC ground state occupation instead of the conventional Gamow factor.? This implies that the fusion rate will increase as the temperature of the system is lowered since the probability of the BEC state is larger at lower temperatures.? These predictions imply that the ABC fusion may be achievable at lower temperatures. A number of key improvement to acoustic cavitation experiments are proposed to check these predictions as well as the results of other experiments.","Bose-Einstein condensation, Pd-black",2082_KimYEquantummana.pdf,,,

Bose-Einstein condensation of integer-spin nuclei was suggested as a possible mechanism for ultra low-energy nuclear reaction in 1998.? Recently, theoretical studies of the BEC mechanism have been carried out by solving approximately many-body Schroedinger equation for a system of N identical charged integer-spin nuclei (""Bose"" nuclei) confined in ion traps.? The solution is used to obtain theoretical formulae for estimating the probabilities and rates of nuclear fusion for N identical Bose nuclei confined in an ion trap or an atomic cluster.? These formulae show that the fusion rate does not depend on the Coulomb barrier penetration probability but instead depends on the probability of the ground-state occupation, which is expected to increase as the temperature decreases.

It is also shown that observed anomalous tritium production can be explained by a sub-threshold resonance reaction mechanism. The basic concept and important features of the BECNF theory is presented, and theoretical explanations of the experimental observations are described. Key experimental tests of theoretical predictions are proposed and discussed.","Bose-Einstein Condensation, Deuteron fusion in metal, Nano-scale materials, Sub-threshold resonance reaction",2095_BiberianJPjcondensedc.pdf,,196.0,209.0

We investigate the role of monopole transition in BECNF theory, assuming a collective monopole vibrational excited nuclear state in 4He. Using the threshold resonance reaction mechanism, we derive formulae for S-factor, which can be used in BECNF theory to obtain the nuclear reaction rate. We find the reaction rate for this reaction is far greater than other exit reaction channels. The proposed monopole transition mechanism is capable of dissipating fusion energy into vibrational (phonon) energies in metal.

For each experimental value of D-D approach the reaction rate was calculated on the shifted Coulomb potential with the shift energy, which equals to the energy of screening. The mean distance of D-D approach on all series equals 0.97 angstroms, that exceeds the mean distance in a molecule D-D.

As a result the rate of the reaction calculated according to the above model should be additionally multiplied by a correction factor, which allows for the probability of the occurrence of these favorable conditions.

The plan is presented from the perspective of a large architect/engineering corporation which performs work in established energy industries and which is not currently involved in cold fusion. The plan consists of a number of phases designed to establish the corporation's level and method of involvement in the field.The phased plan provides a number of decision points; at each decision point a commitment to a higher level of funding is made on the basis of additional information which has been generated by the plan to that point.

These experimental results were obtained by our team during the last 20 years. The main results may be divided into four groups.(1) Excess energy release behind shock wave in a non-equilibrium heterogeneous plasma and plasma precursor creation before its front was revealed in our experiment. This measured energy is much higher than the electric energy consumed by the plasma, COP ~ 4?10. This excess energy is estimated by measured gas density and pressure behind shock wave, its propagation velocity in plasma, and by using gas dynamics conservation laws.(2) A systematic study of new chemical element creation in water by cold heterogeneous plasmoids was performed. The plasmoids are created by RF discharge over water surface. The plasmoid?s chemical composition is determined by optical spectroscopy. The chemical compositions of water and its sediment are studied by independent diagnostic methods: IR spectroscopy, atomic absorption spectroscopy, ion mass spectroscopy, chemical analysis and micro-X-ray spectroscopy. We observed optical lines of the H, Li, K, Ca, OH-molecular bands, CaO-molecular bands and unknown molecular bands inside red plasmoids.

ThisMWplasmoid had unusual physical properties close to those of natural ball lightning. We studied the physical parameters and properties of a longitudinal heterogeneous plasmoid (plasma formation with erosive nano-clusters) created by capacity coupled high-frequency (HF) discharge in high-speed swirl flow in our previous papers. These nano-clusters were created by an electrode?s erosion in a plasma reactor. Measurement of the power balance of this heterogeneous plasmoid is very important for aluminium?hydrogen power energetics, using a new plasma generator with high coefficient of performance (COP). This work is a continuation of our previous work. We determined that there is extra power released in heterogeneous plasmoids created by combined discharge (HF discharge + DC discharge). The measured COP in this plasmoid is about 2?10. We suppose that this extra power release in a heterogeneous plasmoid is connected with LENR. The obtained experimental results (COP, optical spectra, soft X-ray spectra, chemical composition of dusty particles) prove our suggestion. It was revealed that a heterogeneous non-equilibrium plasmoid creates intensive soft X-ray radiation (with quantum energy about 1?10 keV). We determined that excited and charged cluster particles are responsible for this soft X-ray radiation creation, to be exact. Parameters of heterogeneous non-equilibrium plasmoid (Ne, Te, TV, TR and others) were measured in the experimental plasma vortex reactor (PVR). The main goals of this work are the following: (1) Creation of plasma-chemical vortex reactor (PVR) with high COP. (2) Obtaining of the key experimental results in this reactor for the future theoretical LENR model creation based on the PVR?s operation.","Plasmoid, plasma-chemical reactor, Soft X-ray radiation, Swirl flow",2143_BiberianJPjcondensedr.pdf,,153.0,163.0

This work is a continuation of the previous ones [1], [2]. A calorimetric experiment with PG and distant Ni-foil cathode has been carried out in argon atmosphere (Pst~1 Bar). It was determined that HHP consists of the carbon nano-clusters and hydrogen atoms + hydrogen ions. These species are connected with dissociation of the initial PMMA. The interaction of HHP with thin Ni-foil target (width 0.1 ? 1 mm) has been studied in this work. HHP- jet heats, melts and evaporates this thin Ni-foil target. In a result of this interaction a small hole with diameter 1?3 mm in the Ni-foil target was burned by HHP-jet. Parameters of this hole were measured. Ni-foil weight was measured before and after the experiment also.

The chemical compositions of the initial cathode material and the transmuted chemical elements were measured by the EDS method and the ICP-MS method. It was revealed that there is considerable decay-instability of the obtained transmuted chemical elements at the time. This instability is accelerated dramatically by weakly ionized non-equilibrium plasma (WINP) action. It was confirmed that relative concentration of the initial Ni-atoms (cathode material erosion) is not changed, but the relative concentration of the transmuted atoms is dramatically decreased by WINP?s action.

Condensed Matter Nucl. Sci.,34,http://lenr-canr.org/acrobat/BiberianJPjcondensedzg.pdf#page=154,2021-11-22,"Some reports from ICCF22 (Takahashi et al., Iwamura et al., Parkhomov et al., Mizuno et al.) show that selected materials lead to higher power at higher temperatures, probably at temperatures below 2000 K, and pressures below 10 MPa. In the early part of this report, we show the theoretical extrapolation of data described in these recent reports which indicates that low energy nuclear reaction systems at temperatures over 7000 K may release energy at a rate comparable to combustion of fossil fuels, or perhaps even higher. It is also stressed that high pressure levels of 100 MPa physically will lead to less diffusion of H2 (or D2) gas from solid materials (e.g., powder of such as palladium or nickel) that have absorbed the gas. Less diffusion leads to higher power. In the present report, we propose a new reactor which may lead to power at the level of a chemical reaction such as combustion of fossil fuels. This reactor is based on two new basic technologies. Our first technology is a new device with a power source based on focusing compression due to pulsed supermulti-jets colliding around the reaction chamber center, which will have potential of the level of 7000 K and 100 MPa in chamber as maximum, leading to high power. It should be able to continuously produce power as an open system. The high compression potential at level of 100 MPa and 7000 K was confirmed by experiments and computational simulations without chemical and nuclear reactions. Our second technology is an injector of nanoparticles such as those of palladium or nickel, which remains durable for more than 30 hours, which may lead to continuous low energy nuclear reactions. These may make it possible to construct a heat source powered by a low energy nuclear reaction in nanoparticles such as palladium or nickel, which is triggered by a chemical reaction of H2 (or D2)-oxygen mixture, where the reactor is initially brought to a high temperature and high pressure.","Computer simulation, Durability, Experiment, Focusing compression, Injector, Pulsed supermulti-jets colliding, Reaction, Theory",2157_BiberianJPjcondensedzg.pdf,,154.0,172.0

Many experiments were previously conducted while increasing either initial temperature or pressure in the reaction chamber. In this report, we conducted fundamental experiments of hydrogen gas absorption by metal powder, while increasing both temperature and pressure simultaneously. The experiments were conducted in conditions up to 244?C and 0.5 MPa, using a small constant-volume reaction system developed by us. As a result, about 4 K of temperature rise was observed in the experiment using nickel powder, and about 10 K was observed in the experiment using Pd-Ni-Zr composite powder. In these experimental results, there are positive correlations between the temperature rise and both the initial temperature and loaded gas pressure. This result may show that the temperature rise is assisted by not only preheating but also gas absorption under higher pressure.","Anomalous heat, Gas absorption, Temperature dependence, Pressure dependence",2158_BiberianJPjcondensedzi.pdf,,328.0,336.0

Cold fusion (CF) is a mixture of several claims that may or may not be related. Some of them belong to the realm of basic science while others belong to the area of patents. And some seem to be science fiction. From the point of view of history the CF episode, described in several books (1-7) and articles (8,9), is highly unusual. It is a situation in which the validity of research in one particular field has been officially questioned, at least in the US. According to many scientists, the cold fusion claims are in conflict with basic principles of physics and chemistry. That is why most researchers are no longer interested in cold fusion. Surprisingly, however, the field still attracts a large number of investigators with excellent credentials. Once a year they meet at international conferences and publish papers, most often in conference proceedings and over the Internet (10).?

The trapped neutron can form the neutron Cooper pair lowering its energy interacting each other through the phonon. The stabilized neutron, then, will not decay spontaneously and also not be captured by one of the lattice nuclei. To specify the stability of a neutron in a crystal, a new concept ""neutron affinity of a nucleus"" was introduced.

Qualitative correspondence between the relative isotopic abundance of elements in the universe and the number of observations of elements in CFP is shown using more than 40 experimental data, sets.

A characteristic of biological systems where occurs selective adsorption of specific ions seems especially useful for the application.

Early in the history of this controversy, beginning in 1989, a strong polarity existed; many scientists fiercely defended the claim of new physical effects as well as a new process in which like-charged atomic nuclei overcome the Coulomb barrier at normal temperatures and pressures. Many other scientists considered the entire collection of physical observations -- along with the hypothesis of a cold fusion -- entirely a mistake. Twenty years later, some people who had dismissed the field in its entirety are considering the validity of at least some of the reported experimental phenomena. As well, some researchers in the field are wondering whether the underlying phenomena may be not a fusion process but a neutron capture/absorption process. In 2002, a related tabletop form of thermonuclear fusion was discovered in the field of acoustic inertial confinement fusion.

Borosil glass vaporizes at temperatures>1000?C. This fact indicated that a very high temperature has indeed been reached in this experiment. The timing of the explosion (20-25 s after Na addition) indicated that hydrogen somehow got trapped in cavitation induced meta-stable nano-crystals. The excess energy release could not be explained by conventional hydrogen combustion in air. One must therefore look elsewhere for an explanation of the process behind the excess energy release.","Cavitation crystallization, Epsom solution, Excess energy release, Explosion, Hydrogen trapping, Na dissolution",2298_BiberianJPjcondensedh.pdf,,69.0,76.0

Condensed Matter Nucl. Sci.,9,http://lenr-canr.org/acrobat/BiberianJPjcondensedh.pdf#page=77,2012-09-21,"Plausible mechanisms are discussed for explaining the sudden burst of energy released from 0.85MEpsom (MgSO4?7H2O) aqueous solution following sodium metal dissolution which led to the vaporization of the entire system including the glass beaker. Exothermic reactions lead to micro/nano-metastable crystal formation due to steam cavitation. H + 2 molecular ions trapped at Mg2+ ion lattice sites in cavitation-induced metastable crystals were considered as precursors for energy release. In principle, for charge compensation, two protons should occupy one Mg2+ lattice site in these crystals. Therefore, cavitation crystal formation brings in the two protons in molecular ions closer. This process is, however, opposed by Coulombic repulsion between the two protons which results in the collapse of the nanocrystal containing hydrogen. This leads to the release of hydrogen ions into the solution resulting in the release of hydration energy during the formation of H3O+, hydronium ions and in local heating. Stirring distributes the heat energy uniformly in the solution. Local heating, however, leads to the promotion of cavitation - this time with more vigor since additional energy input has occurred. Thus reformation of the crystal takes place quickly and the hydrogen ions are brought together more closer than during the previous occasion which increases the electrostatic repulsive force. As a result, the crystal collapses faster leading to the release of more hydration energy. This is how cavitation gains energy from repulsion. The above cavitation Coulombic repulsion oscillation (CCRO) cycle continues leading to an exponential build-up of the pressure and oscillation speed of the precursors and a decrease in inter-proton separation leading to their collision. Finally a sudden burst of energy witnessed occurs due to cavitation collapse. It remains to be ascertained if the energy release is a consequence of p-p fusion, or other mechanisms proposed which include volume casimir effect, miniature black holes and lattice phonon amplification. The fact that increase in the oscillation speed of the two protons in the proposed H + 2 species is exponential without an upper limit till the end-point is reached should determine the logistics of the underlying mechanism causing the energy release. The p-p fusion should, however, be accompanied by positron emission whose presence could be verified by its annihilation gamma rays or with 5.5 MeV gamma rays produced from HD fusion reactions if energetic deuterium is formed from p-p fusion in amounts commensurate with the energy produced but this fusion process is mediated by weak interaction process and hence is less probable. No other proposal explains burst of energy observed better than the collapse of miniature black holes.","Anomalous heat energy release, Cavitation-Coulombic repulsion oscillation, Collision of protons, Exponential build-up",2299_BiberianJPjcondensedh.pdf,,77.0,112.0

To define better the phenomenon a series of tests have been performed using various metals and alloys and different deuterating conditions. Sheets and shavings of titanium, zirconium, hafnium, tantalum, Zircaloy 2 and Ti-Zr 50% alloy have been tested. A statistical analysis of the tritium production shows that significant differences are obtained varying the type of metal used. Using pure metals the tritium production increases with the increase of the atomic number of the metal. Moreover higher productions of tritium have been obtained using materials of technical purity as tantalum, Zircaloy 2 and Ti-Zr alloy.","tritium, Ti, Zr, Hf, Ta, D2, neutron, ICCF-2",2306_LanzaFtritiumpro.pdf,,,

A closed cell electrolytic experiment has been conducted using a palladium cathode and platinum anode with accurate (+/-0.001 watt) calorimetric measurements. Results indicate a positive energy output of approximately 50 Kilojoules more than was input to the experiment through electrolysis current and heater current. The heat output was observed both as short term bursts of energy and as long term sustained production. Colorimetric calibration with an internal heat source showed essentially identical data before and after the electrolysis experiment. Material balance for palladium, water and lithium showed essentially no material had been consumed during the experiment. Tritium levels measured before and after electrolysis showed a factor of 3 increase that cannot be accounted for by concentration effects.","Excess heat, tritium",2311_Lautzenhiscoldfusion.pdf,,,

The cell temperature T1 is maintained at its set point by varying Paux as needed.

The separation factor of D/T in electrolysis was not measured directly but assumed 2 ~ 3 from literature. The increase of 3T can not be explained with the isotope separation effect.But in the modified cells with recombination, the electrolysis yielded no significant increase of final tritium activities in the total system. In this case, recombined D2O was collected separately and total 3T activities were obtained by combining this with residue in D2O electrolytes.Finally, bell jar type closed cells were designed with recombination catalysts.

Vacancies in the original Fleischmann-Pons experiment are proposed to be created through inadvertent codeposition at high loading. This suggests that a better approach should be to focus on experiments in which Pd codeposition is controlled, such as in the Szpak experiment. Unfortunately, the Szpak experiment has proven difficult to replicate, and we conjecture that this is due to low D/Pd loading. A modified protocol has been tested in which codeposition is carried out at higher current density with a lower PdCl2 concentration.

The reactor, named E-Cat, is charged with a small amount of hydrogen-loaded nickel powder plus some additives, mainly Lithium. The reaction is primarily initiated by heat from resistor coils around the reactor tube. Measurements of the radiated power from the reactor were performed with high-resolution thermal imaging cameras. The measurements of electrical power input were performed with a large bandwidth three-phase power analyzer. Data were collected during 32 days of running in March 2014. The reactor operating point was set to about 1260?C in the first half of the run, and at about 1400 ?C in the second half. The measured energy balance between input and output heat yielded a COP factor of about 3.2 and 3.6 for the 1260?C and 1400?C runs, respectively. The total net energy obtained during the 32 days run was about 1.5 MWh. This amount of energy is far more than can be obtained from any known chemical sources in the small reactor volume. A sample of the fuel was carefully examined with respect to its isotopic composition before the run and after the run, using several standard methods: XPS, EDS, SIMS, ICP-MS and ICP-AES. The isotope composition in Lithium and Nickel was found to agree with the natural composition before the run, while after the run it was found to have changed substantially. Nuclear reactions are therefore indicated to be present in the run process, which however is hard to reconcile with the fact that no radioactivity was detected outside the reactor during the run.","Andrea Rossi, e-cat, Lugano report",2344_LeviGobservatio.pdf,,,

Plastic targets like CR-39 and nuclear emulsions of various kinds are used by researchers as a way to detect various particles and objects, and people are finding anomalous markings on their detectors and on their electrodes. Before them, Matsumoto, Shoulders and I reported finding similar markings in transmutation experiments. I found such markings on the components of an electrolysis cell [1]. I hypothesized that microscopic ball lightning is produced in transmutation experiments. Matsumoto accepted this idea when I told him, and Savvatimova and Urutskoev acknowledge that they have found tracks similar to those in the photographs published by Matsumoto [2, 3]. Their transmutation results are similar also. During this decade, several groups investigated these objects that evidence the characteristics and behavior of ball lightning.",review,2368_LewisEevidenceofb.pdf,,,

Twenty years  ago, this author proposed a theory that these objects will be commonly produced in these kinds of devices. A survey article of such markings and traces exhibited in various experiments from the year 2000 to 2007 was published in this journal in 2009. In it, the author compared the markings to those previously detected by T. Matsumoto and K. Shoulders. In this letter, markings and features that were published more recently by Mosier-Boss et al. and Adamenko et al. are described. The author believes that this kind of highly anomalous microscopic plasmoid is similar to macroscopic natural ball lightning and so calls these objects ""microscopic ball lightning.""

Infinite Energy initiated this discussion about the ""elephant."" Logically speaking, one should read the 162 papers in Storms? JCMNS paper, then comment on this new Storms paper.

The electron capture is the possible weak interaction to make use of this low energy resonance. When the resonance energy level is close to zero, the width of the resonance peak in the fusion cross-section is much greater than the width of the resonance energy level; therefore, the absorption through this low energy resonance level is no longer a problem for resonant tunneling of Coulomb barrier at low energy. Both hot fusion data and the CMNS experiment data support this resonant tunneling concept. As a result, lithium turns out to be an important additive in both CMNS and Hot Plasma fusion research.","Resonance and resonant tunneling, p+6Li low energy resonance, Resonance accompanied with weak interaction, The width of resonance at low energy, 3-Parameter formula for fusion cross-section",2433_BiberianJPjcondensedr.pdf,,172.0,180.0

A eutectic LiCl-KCl molten salt saturated with LiD is used as the electrolyte in a Pd/Al or Ti/Al electrochemical cell. Typical operating temperatures are around 370?C, which results in faster kinetics compared to room temperature operation. If this system can be developed for utility applications, high-grade heat and high thermodynamic efficiencies can be expected. Since the electrolyte provides a very reducing environment, metal surface oxides are readily removed; thus, this unique system offers the possibility of using less expensive materials than Pd. A modified isoperibol calorimeter was built for the excess power measurements. Preliminary results show high levels of excess power output, especially in the Pd-D system, although the effect remains sporadic.This is the Fusion Facts version of the paper, with a different title.","molten salt, heat+, Pd, Fused Salt",2435_LiawBYelevatedte.pdf,,,

No thermochemical explanation can account for this excess heat. Measurements on the hydrogen-based system showed the expected endothermic behavior.The Pd samples were later examined for their morphology and for helium analysis. A porous microstructure of the samples was found. The electrolysis and deuteriding processes changed the morphology substantially. Enhancement of aparticles in the deuterided sample was detected, while the hydrided sample showed an opposite effect. The amount of the alpha-particles in the sample, however, was not commensurate with the measured excess heat.Reproducibility of the experiments has been poor to date.","Pd, molten salt, helium Fused Salt ICCF-2",2436_SIFthescience.pdf,,70.0,79.0

Berichte einer neuen, vielversprechenden Energiequelle liefen um die Welt. Nach einem halben Jahr, einem Negativbericht des US-Energieministeriums und einigen gescheiterten Versuchen, das Experiment zu reproduzieren, setzte sich in Wissenschaft und ?ffentlichkeit die ?berzeugung durch, es habe sich um einen Fehlalarm gehandelt. Jenseits des wissenschaftlichen und ?ffentlichen Mainstreams jedoch haben Wissenschaftler in den letzten 15 Jahren die Forschung vorangetrieben. In Italien und Japan sind daf?r ?ffentliche Gelder zur Verf?gung gestellt worden. In Hunderten Experimenten wird mittlerweile von der Messung von Fusionsprodukten, der Umwandlung von Elementen und einem Energiegewinn berichtet. Die Erforscher der kalten Fusion haben erreicht, dass das US-Energieministerium diese Berichte nun ?berpr?ft. Gespannt wartet die Fachwelt auf den Review. Der vorliegende Bericht schildert Forschungsergebnisse aus 15 Jahren und fragt, wie es m?glich war, dass au?erhalb des Internets kaum Informationen dar?ber bekannt geworden sind. Als Hauptgrund wird genannt, dass die kalte Fusion bisherigen Erkenntnissen widerspricht, Fusion sei nur hei? m?glich. Berichtet wird auch, wie die kalte Fusion von Teilen der Politik und der Wissenschaft aktiv bek?mpft worden ist. In jedem Fall ist die kalte Fusion eine Konkurrenz f?r die hei?e Fusion, in die als Energiequelle der Zukunft bereits Milliardenbetr?ge investiert worden sind.","review, history",2446_LietzHunbeachtet.pdf,,,

These various experiments on charged particle detection show a remarkable feature, namely all exhibit a similar specific energy yield of long-range alphas (1 alpha particle per 10-15 eV input energy/Pd(Ti) target atom) independent of the excitation power of delivering method (electrolysis, glow discharge or laser irradiation). This result suggests the mechanism of energy transfer causing the energetic particle emissions in hydrogen loaded metal targets is similar despite the seemingly dissimilar excitation techniques.","charged particle, CR-39",2496_LipsonAGphenomenon.pdf,,,

A pressurized deuterium run was conducted immediately following the hydrogen exposure on the same sensor and some interesting count burst data was observed.

The measurement is made possible by covering parts of the Pd films with a protective layer of thermal and electric insulators. Electrical contacts are made by using either silver epoxy or indium soldering. The resistance-loading curve deviates somewhat from the typical curve for a bulk Pd/H(D) system. The initial resistance increase shows a much faster hydrogen diffusion rate along the film axis than that observed in bulk systems. The characteristic resistance-loading curve is explained by the electronic band structures of Pd loaded with different H(D) fractions. An excess heat of 30% during the electrolysis process was detected using an open? calorimeter and a novel circuit switching methodology. The corresponding excess power density reaches 100 W/cm^3.,"electrolysis, heat",2558_LuoNinsituchar.pdf,,,

The calculation is performed under the frame work of density functional theory. The results provide new insight into the charge state of H inside Pd. The H is slightly negatively charged over the composition range studied in this paper, and the negative charge around the proton increases with an increasing loading in hydrogen. By studying the behavior of H at the ""bridging"" site, which is also important to surface configuration, this paper helps explain why the effective charge observed in H drift experiments is different from the static charge state.","Hydride, Electronic structure, Charge state, Density functional theory",2559_LuoNmodelingof.pdf,,,

This aspect of loaded hydride is important in that the resistance-loading curve is often used as a diagnostic in experiments to estimate the loading ratio. Understanding transport provides other important insights into some features of the nuclear reaction mechanism. This research involves both ionic and electronic degrees of freedom. For the ionic part, the focus is on the charge state of hydrogen/deuteron, in both a static and a dynamic (hopping) situation. Experiments show that hydrogen hops as fractional-charged positive ion in Pd lattice [1,2] while previous band structure calculations [3-5] always gave a negatively charged H in the ground state. This discrepancy is addressed in the current research and some results are already published [6]. The collective motion of ions is studied in the phonon structure and electron-phonon coupling constant using a perturbation density functional theory. The electronic part focuses on the density of state and the Fermi surface, which when combined with the electron-phonon coupling constant, determine the temperature and the H/D loading dependant resistivity curves. Our numerical results [7] qualitatively match experimental trends. The possible connections between this transport theory/mechanism and the non-equilibrium conditions required for excess heat are discussed.","loading, lattice",2560_LuoNfirstprinc.pdf,,,

Some preliminary results on core electron screening were reported before [1]. The studies focus on two types of nuclear reactions in some metal lattices: fusion between deuterons and also proton capture by medium and heavy lattice nuclei. In both reactions the energy of the light nuclear species, proton or deuteron, is on the KeV (1000 electron volts) scale, while that of heavy nuclei is essentially zero. A standard atomic code is used to obtain the core electron charge density and the potential profile in the metal atom. This Hartree-Fock-Slater type code was originally written by Herman and Skillman and later modified by others and available online. For the D-D reaction, the charge density obtained then gives an estimate on the screening length. The corresponding enhancement in Coulomb barrier tunneling can be obtained from this data.? For the proton capture reaction, an ion dynamic code written to simulate the motion of KeV protons in Pd/Ni lattice, CLAIRE, was modified to take into account the realistic atomic potential, including core electron contributions. In both cases, our result shows a significant nuclear reaction enhancement. The reaction rate calculated roughly matches the scale of excess heat observed in some metal hydride/deuteride experiments.",theory,2561_LuoNenhancemen.pdf,,,

He had concluded that the electrochemical method of Fleischmann and Pons was going to continue to be limited by materials issues -- palladium cracking, composition, etc. -- and the inherent difficulties of working with electrochemical systems.

Kervran (1901-1983), a medical scientist and engineer with a high official position in the French research and occupational health community, had a life-long interest in the possibility of biological transmutations. His curiosity apparently began in his youth when he watched the hens pecking at specks of mica in the farmyard. His later professional observations concerned (in one small part) the anomalous reappearance of robust calcium-bearing eggshells in calcium-deprived chickens that had been administered dietary mica (a potassium-rich mineral). Over a century earlier (in 1799), French chemist Louis Nicolas Vauquelin had noted this.

That was an excellent initial hypothesis. However, the commensurate nuclear ash hypothesis has not been proved, and appears to be approximately correct in only a few experiments.

The thickness of the metal was about one millimeter. In the first of a number of experiments positive indications of fusion were observed but these could not be repeated in subsequent experiments. The inability to repeat results has been found to occur in other cold fusion experiments and signifies that the processes involved are not understood (1). Since 1990, a number of results have been obtained which may put these earlier failures in a new light. In particular, the discovery by Miles (2), who reported positive results during electrolysis from 6mm thick rod after failure with Pd electrodes one mm thick. This introduces the bulk of the metal as a possible factor in the occurrence of cold fusion. Another noticeable feature of the absorption of deuterium in Pd is the obvious signs of cold work done on the metal. The surface is roughened, cracks appear and measurements show an apparent 15% increase in volume. With these factors in mind, a hypothesis has been formulated which seeks to explain how this might influence the process of cold fusion.",gas loading,2697_McIntyreRproposalfo.pdf,,,

A statistical analysis is presented of the results of 176 experiments intended to test the means of establishing reproducible control over D/Pd loading. A set of variables are examined, and procedures identified which permit the attainment of loading above the threshold necessary for excess heat production.Calorimetric results from two experiments are presented and analyzed. A mathematical function is identified which correlates closely with the time evolution of excess power. An important element of this correlation is the measured rate of change of the cathode resistivity. We have interpreted the resistance change as indicating the presence of an oscillation or ""breathing"" of the cathode loading induced by a flux of deuterons through the cathode/electrolyte interface.The observed functionality of excess power with deuteron flux above a loading threshold, conforms closely with theoretical predictions.","Pd, D2, D2O, loading, method, electrolysis, heat+, Al, ICCF-5",2720_PonsSproceeding.pdf,,31.0,48.0

To these ends, in addition to research at SRI International, collaborative research with IAE has been undertaken at SRI and IAE's facility in Sapporo.Research has been performed in a number of areas: Firstly, calorimetric studies of the palladium/heavy water system have been carried out using electrochemical cells housed in well qualified mass flow calorimeters, one design of which is capable of accurate measurement of the helium content of the ceil. Although most results have been obtained for electrolyte temperatures in the range 25-40?C, some experiments have been undertaken in the vicinity of the boiling point of heavy water. In addition to these calorimetric experiments, extensive studies have been made of the electrochemical loading of deuterium into palladium obtained from a variety of sources.While the results obtained are consistent with those obtained previously, by various researchers, it is clear that attainment of the necessary conditions for excess heat production is greatly impeded by a materials-induced variability of a critical parameter which is not presently under our control.","Pd, D2O, electrolysis, heat+, loading, boiling, surface, ICCF-6",2721_NEDOthesixthin.pdf,,90.0,107.0

Results will be presented of calculations intended to characterize the distribution of electrochemical process: current, potential and composition, within the heterogeneous structure of the packed bed cathode. The interpenetrating, continuous conductive elements formed by the solid phase metallic conductor (coating) and the porefilling electrolyte phase, extended in the dimension of current flow, form a system which can be modeled as an electrochemical transmission line.

Examples are given from a set of 26 intentionally similar current ramps which show three distinct Modes of loading performance: Mode A - a linear decrease of Pd resistance, beyond the resistance maximum, with logarithmic increase in electrochemical current; Mode B - an initial log-linear decrease on the Mode A trajectory, followed by a rapid increase in resistance when the resistance falls below a critical value; Mode C -? a shallow decrease in resistance with approximately symmetric increase as the [log] current density is increased beyond a threshold value similar to that for Mode B. Mode A is most frequently associated with the appearance of calorimetrically determined excess heat.","heat+, Pd, D2O, loading, ICCF-7, electrolysis",2724_McKubreMCHmaterialsi.pdf,,,

This newfield has expanded in breadth to the point that numerous acronyms compete to describe overlapping effects. Two of these are: LENR(LowEnergy Nuclear Reactions) and its subset FPE (the Fleischmann Pons Effect). Research to elucidate the basic processes and shed light on mechanisms has proceeded effectively continuously since March 1989 at SRI and elsewhere, and diligently and as ""time and funds"" have allowed at numerous other accomplished institutions worldwide. It is now clear to a well-informed but relatively small group of scientifically interested individuals that the deuterium-palladium systems conceals a heat source with energy exceeding by several orders of magnitude mechanical, lattice storage or chemical energy effects. Evidences of possible dd fusion products have been widely and numerously observed, at least partially ratifying the original speculative designation of ""cold fusion"". The effect, however, is apparently not limited to deuterium as a fuel, to helium as a product or to palladium as a matrix, hence the classification of the field as Condensed Matter Nuclear Science (CMNS) to differentiate these ""new"" effects from those observed in the rarified environments of particle and plasma physics. The materials-related issues associated with the so-called irreproducibility of CMNS effects presents the greatest barrier to the advancement and acceptance of the field. Precisely because we are dealing with condensed matter, micro-structural and micro-impurity control is difficult and expensive, requiring specialized equipment, control and skill. Problems of similar scale (and origin) have been faced and overcome in the past in the development of technologies having similar significance for mankind. Two (of many) examples are: the development of solid-state semiconductors; implementation of conventional nuclear power (and weapons). Absent another Bell Labs or Manhattan Project how should the CMNS field best proceed? Several overlapping options will be discussed. It is well within the capability of ""mainstream"" scientists and engineers in academia, and in national and private laboratories to resolve the materials issues and the questions of whether or not specific products are or are not present. Without funding they will not be encouraged to do so; without (a higher degree of) acceptance, adequate funding will not be made available. This paper will address various options and strategies to surmount this logical dilemma.","Calorimetry, Cold fusion, Deuterium, Electrochemistry, Excess heat, Helium, Palladium",2744_BiberianJPjcondensedg.pdf,,193.0,203.0

This paper reevaluates some of the factual bases for the scientific and management judgments of 1989 with the advantage of what has been learned after four years of worldwide experimentation and analysis. We conclude that there is an FPE and its signature is heat. Data existed in 1989 that could have lead to this conclusion. The source of the excess heat is still not understood.

The hydrogen evolution reaction at sintered nickel in H2O-K2CO3 electrolyte was investigated  by electrochemical and calorimetric techniques. Hydrogen evolution was accomplished with surface conversion of Ni into ?-Ni-hydride, the extent of this reaction being strongly enhanced by temperature.

It was thus found that Pd loading by deuterium is always paralleled by excess power generation, which largely exceeds the electrolytic power input. After prolonged electrolysis the loaded electrodes were found to continue heat generation in open circuit (o.c.) conditions.

A steel plate with a Co-57 substrate on the front surface was vibrated by a piezoelectric transducer near 2.21 MHz; and emission in the X-ray region was recorded with an Amptek X-123 detector on the front side, a scintillator/photomultiplier detector on the back side, and a Geiger counter on the back side. The experiments provided a negative result for the originally sought ultrasonically induced excitation transfer effect, but instead showed non-exponential time histories for photon counts on all three detectors. Specifically, increased emission of the 14.4 keV gamma, Fe K-alpha and K-beta X-rays was observed at early time. This enhancement was present at the start of the experiments at about 19% above expected levels for the 14.4 keV gamma, and about 17% for the Fe K-alpha, with the enhancement decaying away with a time constant of about 2.5 days. Emission on the Sn K-alpha was consistent with the expected exponential decay of Co-57 at the 1% level. Non-exponential decay with an enhancement at early time was also seen for the weak Fe K-alpha escape peak, and in the backside Geiger counter data; and a reduction at early times was seen on the higher energy channels of the scintillator/photomultiplier detector counter both looking at the back side. The observed non-exponential decay is connected with the tightening of bolts on wooden clamps on the corners of the steel plate, which apply mechanical stress to the sample. Candidate interpretations are considered, in which the stress induced in the steel results in scattering and generation of THz phonons by dislocations, and in which phonon?nuclear coupling mediated by THz phonons leads to the transfer of nuclear excitation to other nuclei (""excitation transfer""), which can cause spatial delocalization of the source and angular anisotropy of the photon emission.","Anomaly, Co-57, Excitation transfer, Non-exponential decay, Phonon?nuclear coupling",2781_BiberianJPjcondensedz.pdf,,52.0,102.0

This mechanism, involving optical phonons and electric fields (internally or externally generated) in a lattice that induce the formation of H- H+ (D- D+) pairs, increases the tunneling probability by more than 100 orders of magnitude. It has additional major consequences.The lattice constraints and collision processes force the ions into a temporary, but cyclic, 1-D configuration that greatly deepens the electron ground-state potential well. The tightly-bound and energetic electron pair (a local-charged Boson - the lochon) becomes more than strong screening, it becomes a binding force between the nuclei. Thus, the Coulomb-barrier height is reduced as well as its length. With this greatly enhanced barrier-penetration probability, the energy level of nuclei with reasonable tunneling probability drops from the multi-100 keV range down into the eV range. . . .",Theory,2782_Meulenbergtunnelingb.pdf,,,

In reducing the Coulomb repulsion of the nuclear protons, these electrons bring down the total energy of the fusing D- D+ pair and raise the fragmentation energy level. This process accounts for the observations in CMNS of excess heat (in both p-p and d-d reactions) and for the differing observations (or their absence) of tritium, 3He, neutrons, and 4He in the d-d reaction.

There are also significant differences between lochon- and muon-catalyzed fusion (e.g., one leads to ?cold' fusion and the other the ?hot' fusion). However, since muon-catalyzed fusion is an accepted phenomenon and Lattice-assisted Nuclear Reaction (LANR) or Low-energy Nuclear Reaction ( LENR) is not, we will examine the similarities and differences in various mechanisms with the fusion of deuterons in mind. We start with the assumption that both solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation are actually real and the one that has here-to-for been rejected correctly identifies a single deep orbit below the n = 1 ground state. (It is generally accepted that, at least for spinless bosons such as the lochon, this solution of the Klein-Gordon equation holds.) We then compare the creation model and characteristics of these two naught orbits with those of the muonic orbits (both atomic and molecular). The similarities lead both naught-orbit and muonic-orbit molecules to fusion. The differences lead the non-relativistic (but >100 MeV excess energy) muon-induced fusion of deuterons to the fragmentation of excited helium nuclei and the relativistic (but <10 eV excess energy) lochon-induced D-D fusion to an excited helium 4He* state that is below these fragmentation levels. The reason for this different response to the respective ""tight"" orbits is described along with some of the consequences, e.g., electron capture. In addition, internal conversion, a known physical process involving nucleon interaction with atomic electrons, is compared with the Extended Lochon Model to provide a means of de-exciting 4He* without production of energetic particles or radiation.","Electron-capture, Internal-conversion, LENR, Lochon, Muon-catalysis, Naught-orbit",2786_BiberianJPjcondensedi.pdf,,20.0,34.0

The shapes of both the nuclear potentials and the potential at the bottom of the Coulomb regime have a major role in the coupling between excited nucleons and the DDL electrons. The many orders-of-magnitude differences in frequency of the nucleons, the DDL electrons, and the atomic electrons account for the small interactions under normal circumstances. The changes in these frequencies in radioactive nuclides and for excitation of the DDL electrons account for many of the observed phenomena in cold fusion.","Cold fusion, Deep-Dirac levels, Non-photonic coupling, Nucleon radiation, Potential shapes",2793_BiberianJPjcondensedn.pdf,,132.0,143.0

The regular solutions of these equations are the basis for modern quantum mechanical predictions for comparison with the experimental values of atomic-electron orbital energies. The other solution, discussed in the literature for over 55 years, is relativistic and considered anomalous because its predicted levels are very deep (up to 511 keV) and have never been observed. Nevertheless, the existence of these deep levels provides a ready explanation of the mechanism for penetration of the Coulomb barrier and the means of D?D fusion below the 4He fragmentation levels. Since these levels also provide the basis for all of the other cold fusion observations (both PdD and NiH systems), it is important that arguments for and against the Dirac model be examined. The theoretical support for this anomalous solution is provided in a companion paper in this conference. This presentation seeks: to update the deep-orbit information provided in a poster at ICCF-17, to describe the nature of these deep?Dirac levels (DDLs), to report on additional, but unpublished, results presented by Va?vra in 1998, and to correct some interpretations of the model that Va?vra has provided in 2013. There are some unusual properties of the DDLs relative to those of the known atomic orbitals. Interpretation of the DDL properties, based on the non-relativistic solutions, leads to misunderstandings and further rejection of the concept of the deep levels. We hope to clarify this situation and indicate the importance of the calculations for cold fusion models. Cold fusion results provide a basis for understanding the DDLs and the proposed new fields of femto-physics and femto-chemistry.","Anomalous solution, Dirac equations, Electron deep levels, Hydrogen atom, Relativity",2795_BiberianJPjcondensedr.pdf,,200.0,209.0

If they are valid, then short-lived femto-atoms with electron orbitals in the low femto-meter range should exist. If femto-atoms exist, then the existence of femtomolecules could be expected. This paper addresses the possibility and nature of the femto-molecules and the nature of the forces creating them. The approach is that of Feynman?s molecular-hydrogen ion derivation using the Yukawa potential. The result is a molecular ion with femto-meter order spacing between the nuclei and an attractive potential identical with a medium-range Yukawa potential for an exchange particle with the mass of an electron.

This present paper highlights how relativity and the near-field interactions (of deep-orbit electrons with both the nucleus and the lattice) predict accepted and many reported, but not-yet-accepted, CF observations. Included in the former category are: all of the new fragmentation ratios for the D+D => 4He CF nuclear reaction; a high-probability p?e?p => d reaction; a ?fast? decay process for transitions from excited to ground nuclear states; and a means of transferring excess nuclear energy to the lattice. Included in the latter category are: energy transfer from s-orbit atomic electrons to low-lying nuclear states; the formation of femto-atoms and femto-molecules ? a basis for transmutations without the known ?hard? radiation (particulate or photonic) characteristic of neutron activation processes; selective attraction of femto-atoms/molecules to radio-nuclides (nuclear remediation); and the ?preferred? transmutation pathways in CF. Other effects, based on the published deep-orbit models, are predicted. Because of the successes of these models in explaining so much of CF, their mathematical basis is presently being explored beyond previous work(s). The physical bases for, and the consequences of, the mathematical predictions are proposed and described here. These include: special relativity and binding energy; the deBroglie term and spin-axis precessions; the deep-orbit quantum number, k; and deep-level splitting from spin?orbit, spin?spin, momentum and magnetic interactions. Theoretical concepts such as: symmetry breaking, ?sequestration?, and elementary-particle mass changes to below their rest mass are also addressed. The new results and their interpretation, while incomplete, provide both satisfaction (in resolving prior issues) and surprises (in the magnitude and variety of near-nuclear effects).","Femto-atoms, 500 keV binding energies, Near-field interactions, Nuclear remediation, Relativistic bound electrons, Sub-restmass nucleons, Transmutation",2797_BiberianJPjcondensedw.pdf,,226.0,241.0

However, relativistic quantum mechanics has already provided a means to overcome these limitations. Nevertheless, this ?anomalous? solution has been repeatedly rejected, based on the mathematical formalism of an assumed singular potential, simply because it has not been necessary heretofore in the description of available physical data. The physical realities of a non-singular potential and its interaction with a relativistic electron are not new physics and provide a solid theoretical basis for CF (as indicated in another paper in this conference, and the references therein) and for new fields in femto-physics and nuclear chemistry. This present paper is essentially a reasoned complaint against those critics who proclaim the limitations of the anomalous solution, yet ignore the inapplicability of their chosen potential to the real world where they claim the solution(s) fail. It also castigates those physicists who accept the mathematical limitations as applicable to the real world even when presented with the evidence of assumptions made where they are no longer valid. The paper picks a few of these alleged limitations and shows how relativity and near-field interactions alter predictions based on the mathematical models and approximations used to characterize the conventionally accepted observations. It identifies where the simple models fail, or violate physical reality, and points to the implications of extending the models to better fit the real world and to properly understand the physical mechanism(s) involved.","Deep-electron orbits, Hydrogen atom, Relativistic equations, Singularities",2798_BiberianJPjcondensedw.pdf,,242.0,247.0

One prediction of this model, based on observations from successful cold fusion (CF) results and previously mentioned, is that of hard-radiation-free transmutation. An extension of this important feature is that of the relativistic long-range electromagnetic forces of the deep-orbit electrons that can draw a femto-atom or molecule through a lattice to an excited or unstable nucleus. The earlier papers on this topic assumed the deep-orbit electrons to have kinetic energies in the 1?2 MeV range. Our recent work has replaced and/or augmented the low-MeV range with ~100 MeV values.

The earliest of these D+D cold fusion (CF) models is Julian Schwinger?s proposal (1990) to combine, in a single Hamiltonian, the attractive nuclear potential with the repulsive Coulomb potential to reach an excited state of 4He. The second was a pair of papers by Maly and Vavra (M&V) that, a few years later, provided a relativistic quantum mechanical model basis for deep electron orbits. A third was K.P. Sinha?s 1999 model to use a natural electron pairing in a lattice to form charge-polarized D+ D- pairs in a linear defect that is attractive rather than repulsive. Critical in Schwinger?s model is the ability to dissipate nuclear energy before the actual fusion of the nuclei takes place. Critical to M&V?s model is a deep-electron orbit predicted by relativistic quantum mechanics that, if occupied in deuterium, assured nuclear fusion. Critical in Sinha?s model is the ability to free the hydrogen sub-lattice spacing in a linear defect from the encompassing crystal?s lattice spacing. This present paper includes a connection with the more recently developed model (post-2015) of the deep-electron orbits and even more recent information (2019 and 2020) on new PdD phases and on models of properties of the hydrogen ""chain"". The importance and connection of each model?s contributions with recent information are highlighted. We are not proposing a specific model supported with detailed calculations. We are suggesting that (aspects of) prior models can be combined to form a unified (composite) model that would be more convincing to the other members of the Condensed Matter Nuclear Science (CMNS) community (and others) than they would be individually.","Early cold-fusion models, Linear defects, Nuclear potentials, Sub-lattice motion, Deep-orbit electrons",2800_BiberianJPjcondensedzi.pdf,,346.0,362.0

A significant experimental problem in many isoperibolic calorimetric studies is the fact that the decrease in the electrolyte level due to electrolysis produces a significant decrease in the calorimetric cell constant if the temperature is measured in the electrolyte of the electrochemical cell. Furthermore, heat conduction pathways out of the top of the cell can produce large errors, especially at low power levels.

Recombination can occur when palladium particles are exposed to the gas phase. In this case, our experiments prove that this recombination can be readily detected and easily corrected.

Due to the controversy over methods of data analysis for the F-P cells (see ICCF-5 Proceedings, 1995, pp. 105-115), I developed my own methods while at NHE. As I refined my methods for evaluating the calorimetric measurements, they approached more closely the methods outlined by Fleischmann and Pons in their Icarus Systems handbooks available at NHE. The method previously developed by NHE for the analysis of the F-P cells showed no excess heat for any of these same three experiments. The major problem with the NHE method is that a single calibration was used in determining the effective radiative heat transfer coefficient for the cell. An incorrect heat transfer coefficient can readily confuse the excess heat effect with the calorimetric error for the system. Calorimetric results for the same experiment using the NHE method, my method, and the F-P method for data analysis are compared. The fact that the alternative NHE method showed no excess heat for F-P cells illustrates the problem in transferring calorimetric methods from one laboratory to another. The second laboratory often fails to follow directions and makes changes that compromise the calorimetry. Similar problems were encountered in the attempt to transfer the China Lake calorimetry to NRL, hence excess heat was not observed.","heat+, Pd, D2O, electrolysis, Pd-B, Pd-Ce-B, Pd-Ce, critique, ICCF-8",2833_MilesMcalorimetrb.pdf,,,

Contrary to the conclusions reached in the N.H.E. report (1) we find that these experiments show ""Heat-after-Death"" and excess enthalpy generation at temperatures close to the boiling points of the electrolytes. The experiment using the Pd-B cathode also shows excess enthalpy generation in other temperature regions as well as the very early development of ""positive feedback"" (compare (10), (11), (12)). Such ""positive feedback"" complicates the analyses of the experiments.

These measurements clearly show the anomalous increase in the cell temperature despite the steadily decreasing electrical input power during Pd/D2O+LiOD/Pt electrolysis. This strange behavior can be modeled by the use of an anomalous excess power term in the calorimetric equations. Two thermistors used in each calorimetric cell always show nearly identical temperature changes, thus errors due to temperature gradients within the cell are unlikely. The onset of the excess power apparently develops in a gradual manner. There were never any large, abrupt increases in the excess power. The addition of D2O with its sudden cooling of the cell generally dissipated the excess power effect. No clear triggering events for the excess power could be identified. Possible chemical explanations for the excess power are discussed.

Therefore, the largest excess enthalpy effects are often observed near or at the boiling point corresponding to that of the electrolyte solution in the cell. The exact boiling temperatures at different electrolyte concentrations are needed for cold fusion experiments. These studies of LiOH in H2O and LiOD in D2O both show boiling point elevations at higher concentrations that are significantly lower than theoretical calculations based on ideal solutions. Activity coefficients of LiOD in D2O at the boiling point of D2O (101.42?C) are also reported. These boiling point measurements suggest a purity problem with heavy water samples that may contribute to the reproducibility problem for excess enthalpy.","Pd,, D2O,, electrolysis,, heat,, boiling point,, ICCF-9",2840_MilesMtheelevati.pdf,,,

Completely new experiments have produced even larger excess power effects for this deuterated co-deposition system. The largest excess power effect in D2O produced 1.7Wor about 13 W/g of palladium (160 W/cm3). These large excess power effects were absent in extensive studies of H2O controls. Excess power was also absent in various experiments involving the co-deposition of ruthenium (Ru), rhenium (Re), and nickel (Ni) in both H2O and D2O ammonia solutions. The statistical analysis of all 18 co-deposition experiments yields a probability of greater than 99.9989 % that the co-deposition excess power effect requires both palladium metal and D2O. Shuttle reactions have been proposed to explain the reproducible excess power effect in this ammonia co-deposition system. However, various electrochemical studies show no evidence for any shuttle reactions in this ammonia system. Nevertheless, the initial chemistry for the Pd system is complex leading to large pH changes, chlorine (Cl2) evolution, and the formation of nitrogen trichloride (NCl3) during the first few days. However, the large excess power effects are observed later in the experiments after this chemistry is completed.

The MIT isoperibolic calorimetric results published in 1990 had a major impact in convincing scientists, as well as US Patent officials, that the anomalous excess enthalpy reported in 1989 by Fleischmann and Pons in Pd/D systems was due to various calorimetric errors. Additional information about the MIT calorimetry has allowed a more detailed analysis. The major new finding is that the walls of the MIT calorimetric cell were so well insulated with glass wool (2.55 cm thickness) that the major heat transfer pathway was out of the cell top into the room air rather from the cell into the constant temperature water bath. This helps to explain the reported sensitivity of 40mWfor the MIT calorimetry versus the sensitivity of 0.1mWachieved for the Fleischmann-Pons Dewar calorimetry. The evaluation of calorimetric designs, accuracy of temperature measurements, electrolyte level effects, calorimetric equations, and data analysis methods leads to the clear conclusion that the Fleischmann-Pons calorimetry was far superior to that of MIT.

Ruthenium (III) nitrosylnitrate, Ru(NO)(NO3)3, was investigated in the NH4Cl + NH4OH/H2O and ND4Cl + ND4OD/D2O electrolytes. The ruthenium solution had an intense red color that remained unchanged during extensive electrolysis at constant  currents of 6, 10, 20 and 100 mA. However, at a constant current of 400 mA, the solution became completely clear overnight with a black deposit of ruthenium metal covering the copper cathode. The collapsed cyclic voltammetric trace indicated a large electrode capacitance (1?2 F) and a large ruthenium surface area (105 cm2) similar to the previous observations for palladium co-deposition in this ammonia system. Extensive calorimetric studies using a constant current of 200 or 300 mA produced no measureable excess power in H2O or D2O for this ruthenium system. The very stable calorimetry allowed the determination of the effect of the electrolyte level on the cell constant at 0.0008 W/K mL for both the Ru/H2O and the Ru/D2O systems. The mean cell constants were 0.1318 ? 0.0025 W/K for the Ru/H2O study and 0.1312 ? 0.0025 W/K for the Ru/D2O experiment. There was no chemical excess power or shuttle reactions due to the nitrate ions present in these ruthenium solutions. In contrast to the palladium co-deposition studies, there was no detection of chlorine or nitrogen trichloride formation in any ruthenium co-deposition study. Based on out-gassing observations when the current was turned off, there was no absorption of hydrogen or deuterium within the bulk of the deposited ruthenium metal.

Furthermore, Fleischmann mathematically shows that there is never a true steady state in the cell temperature for an open isoperibolic calorimetric system because both the cell heat transfer coefficient and the heat capacity of the cell change with time. Therefore, an important power term involving the change of the cell temperature with time has often been neglected by various groups using isoperibolic calorimetry. This power term is especially important when there are large changes in the cell temperature with time such as when the cell is first turned on.","Calorimetry, Cell temperature, Critics, Excess enthalpy, Helium",2863_BiberianJPjcondensedr.pdf,,218.0,226.0

This all changed with the NRL preparation of palladium-boron (Pd-B) alloy cathodes in 1994.  Seven out of eight experiments using these NRL Pd-B cathodes produced significant excess power in calorimetric studies at the Navy laboratory at China Lake, California (C/L).  The one failure was related to a folded over metal region which acted as a long crack on the electrode surface.  This success with Pd-B alloys made by NRL came too late to prevent the closure of the U.S. Navy cold fusion program in 1995, but these results are documented in a Navy report.","excess heat, palladium, boron",2865_MilesMexcesspowe.pdf,,,

Three other research groups have also found excess power effects using these Navy Pd?B cathodes. Possible important factors for Pd?B electrodes are the removal of oxygen by the boron during processing, the increased mechanical strength versus pure palladium, less volumetric expansion of these electrodes during loading with deuterium, and the much slower escape of deuterium from this cathode.","Boron, China Lake, Cold Fusion, Deuterium, Excess power, NRL, Palladium, US Navy research",2868_BiberianJPjcondensedzb.pdf,,21.0,29.0

This theory has also been applied to physical rate processes such as diffusion and the viscosity of liquids. The activation parameters obtained from the Eyring theory when applied to cold fusion are all suggestive of a deuterium fusion rate controlled by the diffusion of deuterons within the palladium lattice. The D+D fusion process in the Pd/D system is apparently a zero-ordered reaction where only a small fraction of the reactants are in a location in which they are able to react.,"Activation energy, Activation entropy, Deuterium, Diffusion, Palladium, Reaction zones",2870_BiberianJPjcondensedzd.pdf,,54.0,57.0

The immense potential energy benefits of CF (also referred to as Low Energy Nuclear Reactions, LENR) were immediately recognized. Humankind?s need for a source of cheap, clean, inexhaustible, and safe energy seemed to be realized. However, LENR was rejected by mainstream science within a few months, and it remains highly marginalized to this day. On the other hand, it has continued to be rigorously pursued by many investigators in several countries. Dr. Mel Miles is one of the foremost researchers in the LENR field. He began his LENR research while at the Naval Air Weapons Center (NAWC) at China Lake. His goals were to determine if helium was produced in LENR along with excess heat and to show that the ratio of production of helium to energy release is the same as in plasma fusion reactions . Dr. Miles was successful in answering both of these questions affirmatively.","history, preservation, LRDI, LENR Research Documentation Initiative, Miles, biography",2873_MilesMdrmelmiles.pdf,,,

These elements were at the most, only present in the initial film and the electrolyte plus other accessible cell components in much smaller amounts.

Related results, often termed ""transmutation"" studies, have been reported by other researchers.? These observations suggest that proton-metal initiated reactions occur in such LENR cells. This paper discusses evidence that the production of these reaction products is correlated with the excess heat also frequently observed in LENR cells.

Both experimental and theoretical studies have demonstrated that due to the close distance between ions in the cluster, they can easily be induced to undergo intense nuclear reactions among themselves and some neighboring lattice atoms. In view of their multi-body nature, such reactions are termed Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENRs) -- a terminology generally accepted by workers in the cold fusion field. Since the interacting ions have little momentum, the compound nucleus formed in these reactions is near the ground state so few energetic particles are emitted from it?s decay. Triggering excess heat generation, thus nuclear reactions in LENR experiments has been accomplished in various ways, all involving the loading of protons or deuterons into a solid metal or alloy material.",Theory,2909_MileyGHlenrreacti.pdf,,,

From these systematic data role of the bulk and surface properties of the cathode in determining the maximum loading has been discussed. The cathode loading is improved for Pd and Pd-Rh with a surface modified by thiourea and Pd modified by Pd-Rh deposit, while reduction of the cathode loading was observed when the surface of the Pd-Rh alloy cathode was modified by P d -black. These results show clearly importance of controlling the surface catalytic property of the cathode in controlling and improving the maximum cathode loading. It has been found that DlP d > 0 . 95 can be achieved reproducibly in electrolyte solutions containing thiourea at high concentrations. However, electrolysis in solutions containing thiourea can be conducted successfully only when the anode and cathode are separated by an ion exchange membrane in order to avoid theconsumption of thiourea by anodic oxidation at the anode.","loading, Pd, D2O, Pd-Rh, resistivity, D/Pd, electrolysis, ICCF-5",2930_PonsSproceedinga.pdf,,188.0,211.0

From the fact that the No. 2 run after the forced deoxidation has essentially the same values of the absorption parameters as those of the No. 1 and No. 3 runs, it is inferred that the surface adsorption potential is made shallower in the PNZ2B sample than in Pd-based samples.

Drs. Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons had claimed that an electrochemical cell with heavy water electrolyte and a palladium cathode put out so much excess energy that the mysterious phenomenon had to be nuclear, and was probably a process related to nuclear fusion. Newspapers and magazines said it might be a major scientific discovery with the potential to end the energy crisis and revolutionize society. For a few heady weeks the public took it seriously and waited anxiously for laboratories to replicate the results. Many scientists quickly took sides for or against cold fusion - mostly against. Then, by the end of the summer of 1989 the official word came, in an authoritative report written by a select panel of experts under the auspices of the Department of Energy: cold fusion was a bust. It did not exist. It was an experimental error. It could not be reproduced. Nearly every scientific journal, magazine and newspaper on earth reported this, and cold fusion abruptly dropped out of the headlines. The story, it seemed, was over. Actually, it had barely begun. Only a few thousand electrochemists in the world were qualified to do the experiments, and most of them were too busy or not interested in trying. In that autumn as public interest faded and the U.S. Department of Energy pronounced a death sentence, a small number of experienced scientists prepared serious, full-scale experiments.

We employed a He-3 neutron detector and a NE-2 1 3 scintillator to measure neutron emission and energy distribution. We counted up to several million neutrons per second. High heat output of the order of several hundred watts was observed from input power of tens of wattsThe neutron counts detected by the He-3 detector increased with discharge time after an induction period, and showed radical fluctuations. Absorption of neutrons by cadmium showed them to be thermal Copper and iron showed no count changes. The rate of neutron emission increased with the input volt Moreover, the rate was increased with the concentration of the ions and their mass number. Their rate was ten times higher in heavy water than light water solution. The neutron emission rate corresponded linearly with the input current, except at the low input coulomb range due to induction time. From this linear relation, it was observed that the typical dependence of neutron emission/current during 1 hour was 1000000 /s/A/cm2 for a platinum electrode in 0.5 molar potassium carbonate of heavy water solution.We can conclude that a nuclear reaction would be induced by the electric discharge on the metal surface in the solution.

Hydrogen gas is usually obtained by the electrolysis. Pyrolysis decomposition of water occurs at high temperatures, starting at ~3000?C. As we have already reported, anomalous hydrogen is sometimes generated during plasma electrolysis. Excess hydrogen usually appears once certain difficult conditions during high temperature glow discharge electrolysis are met. Here, we show that anomalous amounts of hydrogen and oxygen gas are generated during plasma electrolysis excess gas generation, presumably from pyrolysis. This is indirect proof that exceptionally high temperatures have been achieved. (Direct measurement of the reaction temperature has proved difficult.) Continuous generation of hydrogen above levels predicted by Faraday?s law is observed when temperature, current density, input voltage and electrode surface meet certain conditions. Although only a few observations of excess hydrogen gas production have been made, production is sometimes 80 times higher than normal Faradic electrolysis gas production.","plasma electrolysis, hydrogen generation, current efficiency, heat",2965_MizunoTconfirmatib.pdf,,,

In this paper we discuss the anomalous amount of hydrogen and oxygen gas generated during plasma electrolysis. The generation of hydrogen in amounts exceeding Faraday?s law is continuously observed when the conditions such as temperature, current density, input voltage and electrode surface are suitable. Non-Faradic generation of hydrogen gas is sometimes 80 times higher than the gas from normal electrolysis.

Neutron emissions were observed in ten out of ten test cases. Neutron burst of 5.5 c/s were 1000 times higher than the background counts. These bursts occurred one or two times within a 300 second interval. The total neutron emission can be estimated from the counting efficiency, and it was 104 ~ 105 c/s. The reaction appears to be highly reproducible, reliably generating high neutron emissions. We conclude that the models proposed heretofore based upon d-d reactions are inadequate to explain the present results, which must involve magnetic field nuclear reactions.",neutron,2967_MizunoTneutronemi.pdf,,,

Hydrogen gas can be usually obtained by electrolysis or by a pyrolysis reaction at high temperatures, starting at approximately 3700?C. However, as we have already reported, anomalous heat generation can occur during plasma electrolysis, and this process makes it rather easy to achieve both electrolysis and pyrolysis simultaneously. In this paper we describe anomalous amounts of hydrogen and oxygen gas generated during plasma electrolysis. The generation of hydrogen far in excess of amounts predicted by Faraday?s law is continuously observed when conditions such as temperature, current density, input voltage and electrode surface are suitable. Non-Faraday generation of hydrogen gas sometimes produces more than 80 times as much hydrogen as normal electrolysis does. Unfortunately there have been few claimed replications of excess hydrogen, even in rare cases in which excess heat is claimed. In most cases, no excess heat or hydrogen is observed. The reaction products found after electrolysis were different after excess heat generation.","plasma electrolysis, glow discharge, hydrogen generation, transmutation",2968_MizunoTgenerationa.pdf,,,

If hydrogen should be considered an energy storage medium rather than a natural resource. However, free hydrogen does not exist on earth. Many techniques for obtaining hydrogen have been proposed. It can be reformulated from conventional hydrocarbon fuels, or obtained directly from water by electrolysis or high-temperature pyrolysis with a heat source such as a nuclear reactor. However, the efficiencies of these methods are low. The direct heating of water to sufficiently high temperatures for sustaining pyrolysis is very difficult. Pyrolysis occurs when the temperature exceeds 4000?C. Thus plasma electrolysis may be a better alternative, it is not only easier to achieve than direct heating, but also appears to produce more hydrogen than ordinary electrolysis, as predicted by Faraday?s laws, which is indirect evidence that it produces very high temperatures. We also observed large amounts of free oxygen generated at the cathode, which is further evidence of direct decomposition, rather than electrolytic decomposition. To achieve the continuous generation of hydrogen with efficiencies exceeding Faraday efficiency, it is necessary to control the surface conditions of the electrode, plasma electrolysis temperature, current density and input voltage. The minimum input voltage required induce the plasma state depends on the density and temperature of the solution, it was estimated as 120V in this study. The lowest electrolyte temperature at which plasma forms is ~75?C. We have observed as much as 80 times more hydrogen generated by plasma electrolysis than by conventional electrolysis at 300 V.","glow discharge, calorimetry, excess hydrogen",2970_MizunoThydrogenev.pdf,,,

The anomalous energy generation cannot be the product of a conventional chemical reaction for the following reasons: At these temperatures, hydrogenation reactions are endothermic, not exothermic. The total heat release far exceeded any known chemical reaction with this mass of reactants. There is virtually no chemical fuel in the cell. There were few chemical reaction products. The components and chemical species in the cell including oil and hydrogen gas remained essentially as they were when experiment began, except that the platinum screen was coated with carbon. The emissions are thought that had been generated from some nuclear reaction. The reaction is reliably triggered by raising temperatures above the threshold temperature of ~530?C and the hydrogen pressures above 60 atm. It can be quenched by lowering the temperature inside the cell below ~500?C. When the necessary conditions are achieved, generation of heat is observed with high reproducibility. However, the amount of heat generated is not stable. Only a small amount of reactant is consumed during the experiment, presumably by conventional chemical reactions.

The announcement, which came to be known as ""Cold Fusion,"" caused frenzied excitement. In both the scientific and news communities, fax machines were used to pass along fragments of rumor and ""facts."" (Yes, this was before wide spread use of the internet. One can only imagine what would happen now.) Companies and individuals rushed to file patents on yet to be proven ideas in hopes of winning the grand prize. Unfortunately, the phenomenon described by Fleischmann and Pons was far from being understood and even factors necessary for repeatability of the experiments were unknown. Over the next few months, the scientific community became divided into the ""believers"" and the ""skeptics."" The ""believers"" reported the results of their work with enthusiasm that at times overstated the significance of their results. On the other hand, many ""skeptics"" rejected the anomalous behavior of the polarized Pd/D system as a matter of conviction, i.e., without analyzing the presented material and always asking ""where are the neutrons?""

The evaluation is based on conservation laws subject to constraints dictated by cell design and the adapted experimental procedure. Volume 2 of this report deals with the modeling and simulation of the Dewar-type calorimeter. It was written by Professor Fleischmann to provide an authoritative discussion of the calorimetry of electrochemical cells. The emphasis is on the interpretation of data and the accuracy of the determination of the excess enthalpy generation via the appropriate selection of heat transfer coefficients. The discussion of the calorimetry of the Dewar-type cells is presented in the form of technical report for a number of reasons, among them: (i) its length would likely prohibit publication in topical journals, (ii) to clarify misunderstandings regarding the principles of calorimetry as applied to electrochemical cell in general and to the cell employed by Fleischmann and his collaborators, in particular.

Palladium is then electrochemically reduced onto the surface of the working electrode in the presence of evolving deuterium gas. Electrodes prepared by Pd/D co-deposition exhibit highly expanded surfaces consisting of small spherical nodules. Because of this high surface area and electroplating in the presence of deuterium gas, the incubation time to achieve high D/Pd loadings necessary to initiate LENR is orders of magnitude less than required for bulk electrodes. Besides heat, the following nuclear emanations have been detected using Pd/D co-deposition: X-ray emission, tritium production, transmutation, and particle emission.

They speculated that the heat had a nuclear origin. The experiments were quickly dubbed ""Cold Fusion"" by the news media. The physics community noted that Fleischmann and Pons had not published their results in any journal prior to their announcement, there had been no reports of any replications of the effect, there was no mention of the generation of any nuclear ash, and that the reported results did not match theory. Despite these perceived irregularities scientists, worldwide, went into their laboratories to replicate the Fleischmann?Pons results. A few scientists succeeded but a great many more failed. It is now known that those failures were due to the fact that the experimental conditions necessary to achieve the effect, i.e., high D loading and high D flux inside the Pd lattice, had not been achieved.

At the surface of the Sr implanted Pd/CaO multilayer foil, Mo was clearly detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) after deuterium gas permeation. After the D2 permeation, the sample was heat treated in the air to remove S which condensed at the surface during the permeation. After the successful removal of S, Mo could be clearly detected by XPS on the surface of the 88Sr+ implanted Pd/CaO multilayer foil. The isotopic abundance ratio of the surface Mo measured by TOF-SIMS was similar to that of natural Mo. However, after the removal of the outermost surface layer with ion sputtering, the observed isotopic abundance ratio of Mo changed from that of natural Mo with an isolatedly strong peak at a mass close to 96Mo. This result duly suggests that the transmutation from 88Sr to 96Mo had took place, although the peak of m/z = 96 might be also assigned to GaAl+, Ca2O+ or CaFe+, beside 96Mo+. By further analyses of the TOF-SIMS data from the viewpoint of accurate masses, depth profiles and isotopic abundances, it was clarified that the peak of m/z = 96 was assigned to Ca2O+ originated from Pd/CaO multilayer.","Deuterium permeation, Pd/CaO multilayer, Time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, Transmutation, X-ray, photoelectron spectroscopy",3051_BiberianJPjcondensede.pdf,,43.0,52.0

The topic called ""cold fusion"" caused reexamination of the physics of nuclear reactions and some aspects of the philosophy of science. We will consider these factors after a brief introductory survey of the complex experiments and results reported in the field, and the motivations for continued attention.

Experimental evidence indicates that low energy nuclear reactions (LENR) occur on or very near to the surfaces of solid lattices. The rates of such reactions depend on the total area of the lattices in an LENR experiment, the fraction of that area which is active and the number of reactions per area per second. The powers further depend on the energy per reaction. The production rates of materials are related to the masses of the reaction products. And, the fluxes of radiations depend on the fraction of the reactions that produce energetic quanta. These factors are examined in this paper. A simple, but useful graphical method to relate surface areas to output nuclear powers is presented. It is used to make the first estimate of the active fraction of a surface in LENR experiments. Optimization of power outputs from LENR experiments is discussed in relation to the various factors cited above and to past work. The several intersections between LENR and both nano-science and nanotechnology are examined. A new engineering discipline will be required to turn the current science of LENR into practical sources of energy, materials and maybe radiations.","materials, electrode surface morphology",3067_NagelDJpowersmate.pdf,,,

Because of the small size of hypothetical compact objects, it is thought that the protons or deuterons at their centers might subsequently participate in nuclear reactions, producing more energy, transmutation products or energetic quanta.

This may bring about a more stable occurrence of cold fusion. This approach due to supermulti-jets will also cause an insulation effect because of encasing, which will result in less heat loss from the reactor walls. Based on this, we developed three types of prototype engine reactors using the supermulti-jets colliding with pulse.

During a 11-week long non-stop round the clock operation of the plant in 1995, daily feed of raw materials was: Quartz (33.4 ton), charcoal (with fixed carbon content of 13.2 ton) and scrap steel (5.1 ton) while the daily output production of Fe?Si alloy (73.5% Si) was 24.75 ton. From the total weights of Si and Fe in the input feed and assuming 100% recovery of the metals, the daily output alloy production could at best have been only 20.5 ton. However to our surprise throughout the 11-week period the total daily Fe?Si alloy (with 73.5% Si) output was consistently 24.75 ton, corresponding to a daily ""anomalous"" excess metal production of 4.25 ton of Fe?Si alloy. The only source of Si entering the smelter furnace was the quartz raw material and that of Fe was the scrap steel (except for minor additional amounts of Fe originating from the steel casing of the consumable S?derberg carbon electrodes). Very careful vigil of the weights of daily input feed of raw materials and output alloy drained out as also the electrical energy consumption was maintained. It was evident that roughly 20% more metal than could be accounted for from the input feed was being produced and consequently we have been obliged to come to the conclusion that anomalous quantities of Si (2.8 ton/day) and Fe (1.45 ton/day) were being synthesized during the smelting process. Discussions with researchers involved in the Cold Fusion/LENR field have suggested that a likely explanation for the anomalous metal production could be the occurrence of transmutation reactions between nuclei of C and the O stripped from the SiO2 during the chemical reduction process. It is speculated that the intense varying magnetic fields generated by the kilo-amp levels of alternating current (AC) driving the arcing between the three gigantic carbon electrodes and the carbonic hearth of the furnace, in the 2000?C temperature environment, could have somehow catalyzed transmutation reactions to occur, very similar to the transmutations reported in laboratory scale ""Carbon-Arc experiments"" first revealed by George Oshawa in 1964. But the more puzzling aspect of our observations is that there was no evidence of release of the expected massive amounts of nuclear energy that should have accompanied the postulated transmutation reactions based on the atomic masses of the nuclei involved.","Carbon Arc, Energy balance, Fe?Si alloy, Transmutation",3104_BiberianJPjcondensedw.pdf,,256.0,263.0

H+ used as a precursor nuclear material can be implanted in solid-state carbon material. We must then consider all effects that can affect nuclear collision efficiency, including solid-state structure specificity, proton channeling and the reduction of the original proton energy with electronic interactions, before looking at the possible nuclear reactions themselves. We then have to consider the different effects and types of atomic rearrangement favoring either sp2 or sp3 sites or which influence the carbon material structure. For this purpose, we review first a recently developed theoretical approach, which might explain important aspects of this phenomenon with still high confidence up to now. These aspects include quantum electronic activation especially with H2 recombination energy release, which is different from usual chemical and metallurgical thermal atomic rearrangement with which an optimized ta-C sp3 carbon structure can be controlled. It should also be considered that carbon structure determination methodology ? including the recently revised Raman theory ? provide more correct and accurate results. To be falsified a study of this type of proton?carbon nuclear reactor must also take into account effects which modify the carbon nucleus structure in favor of nuclear fusion. It is suggested that anharmonic synchronic phonon?nuclear resonance may be a contributing factor. However, present failures and the limits of abstract Quantum Mechanical formalism bring little clarification on this last point, which we suggest is owing to insufficient physical description of particle wave character. In order to improve these aspects of the theory, we suggest revisiting aether theory which with further investigation and development of 3D fluid mechanics is expected to account for all QM acquired, and to be able to provide clearer physical insight into the subatomic particle wave aspects and corresponding nuclear reaction mechanism.","Anharmonic phonon?nuclear resonance, Bethe?Weizs?cker proton CNO fusion reactor, Carbon material characterization, Synchronic phonon/proton?nucleus collision, Quantum electronic atomic rearrangement",3126_BiberianJPjcondensedv.pdf,,96.0,121.0

The 28 liter cell used in these verification tests was on loan from a private corporation whose own tests with similar cells are documented to produce 50 W steady excess heat for a continuous period exceeding hundreds of days. The apparent excess heat can not be readily explained either in terms of nonlinearity of the cell's thermal conductance at a low temperature differential or by thermoelectric heat pumping. However, the present data do admit efficient recombination of dissolved hydrogen-oxygen as an ordinary explanation. Calorimetry methods and heat balance calculations for the verification tests are described.

Although much discussion was (and is still) devoted to whether this effect is connected with any known nuclear reactions, the latter being widely questioned, there is no doubt that the general interest in the problem was provoked by the claim of the possibility of producing excess energy, i.e., energy surmounting the energy breakeven value. Unlike the clearly negative indications so far in terms of known nuclear processes taking place, however, careful analysis reveals that the claims in the principal negative papers published so far with respect to the existence of excess energy are in disagreement with the raw experimental data whenever such is presented in those papers. This is very surprising indeed in view of the wide publicity these negative results have been given. An example of an improper analysis of their own experimental data by the authors is Ref. 1, which we have already discussed. Other examples of inappropriate method and improper interpretation of their own experimental data are Refs. 3 and 4.","critique, Lewis, Albagli, heat, MIT",3144_NoninskiVCnotesontwo.pdf,,,

CR-39 plastic detectors, designed for recording alpha particles from radon decay, were immersed in the electrolyte during electrolysis. They recorded significantly larger numbers of energetic particle tracks than were recorded by control detectors not subject to electrolysis. Statistical analysis shows only a 3 * 10^-6 probability that the electrolysis tracks and the control tracks could have arisen from a common population. We conclude that there is a causal relationship between electrolysis and the production of energetic charged particles. Because track formation requires particle energies substantially greater than thermal or electrochemical energies it seems inescapable that a nuclear reaction was responsible.","electrolysis, heavy water, lithium sulfate, palladium cathode, CR-39, charged particle, nuclear reaction",3233_OrianiRAgeneration.pdf,,,

However, not every electrolysis experiment produced nuclear particles so that total reproducibility was not achieved. Therefore another experimental technique has been developed which has shown the generation of nuclear particles in each of twenty five consecutive electrolysis experiments using heavy or light water solutions of lithium salts. The damage trails caused by the nuclear particles are made visible by etching in hot concentrated caustic solution, and the electrolysis experiments are accompanied by suitable blank, or control, experiments. The damage trails begin either at the surface of the CR39 chip that faces toward the electrolyte, at the opposite surface, or totally within the 0.83 mm thickness of the plastic detectors.

Though there are good reasons against many publications to this topic but not to all what was reported. It seems to be indicated to summarize the following serious, reproducible and confirmed observations on reactions of protons or deuterons incorporated in host metals such as palladium, nickel and other metals. We underline the confusing discovery by Cockroft and Oliphant with the anomalously low energy for nuclear reactions which was hundred times lower than in the usual cases when smashing nuclei against their Coulomb potential. A similar unexpected result was that of Otto Hahn?s-the chemist!-discovery of fission that had changed the world. A significant result for cold fusion was seen in gaseous atmosphere or discharges between palladium targets, rather significant and fully reproducible, e.g. from the ""life after death"" heat production of such high values per host atom that only nuclear reactions can be involved. This supports the earlier evaluation of neutron generation in fully reversible experiments with gas discharges hinting that a reasonable screening effect-preferably in the swimming electron layer-may lead to reactions at nuclear distances d of picometers with reaction probability times U of about megaseconds similar to the K-shell capture radioactivity. Further electrolytic experiments led to Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR) where the involvement of pollution could be excluded from the generation of very seldom rare earth elements. A basically new theory for DD cross sections is used to confirm the picometer-megasecond reactions of cold fusion. Other theoretical aspects are given from measured heavy element distributions similar to the standard abundance distribution, SAD, in the Universe with consequences on endothermic heavy nuclei generation, magic numbers and to quarkgluon plasmas. One application may be the elimination of long lived nuclear waste by transmutation into stable nuclei.",theory,3241_OsmanFsupporting.pdf,,,

The stress change, which may be caused by hydrogen uptake, was estimated using palladium film-coated AT- and BT-cut quartz crystal oscillators.

The production of excess heat was absent from a control experiment using LiOH/H2O in the place of LiOD/D2O. It seemed that the magnitude and reproducibility of the excess heat production were improved by the addition of S^2- to the electrolyte solutions. In this study, in situ observations of topographic changes at electrode surfaces during the electrolysis were also conducted using phase measurement interferometric microscopy (PMIM). The absorption of hydrogen into a Pd cathode was clearly seen to bring about surface roughening even at a very low hydrogen content of less than H/Pd=0.005. Original surface topography was readily restored by desorbing hydrogen from the Pd electrode by using it as the anode. The absorption and desorption of deuterium similarly induced the reversible surface topography change. The extent of the surface roughening due to the hydrogen absorption varied with electrode materials and crystal facets of Pd single crystals.","Pd, heat+, electrolysis, S, D2O, surface analysis, ICCF-6",3262_NEDOthesixthin.pdf,,249.0,253.0

In a first part we quickly recall the known criticism against the EDO and how we face it. In particular, a solution to fix all problems is to consider a modified Coulomb potential with finite value inside the nucleus. For this reason, we deeply analyzed the specific work of Maly and Va?vra on deep orbits as solutions of the Dirac equation, with such a modified Coulomb potential without singular point. Then, by using a more complete ansatz, we made numerous computations on the wavefunctions of these EDOs, allowing to confirm the approximate size of the mean radii ?r? of orbits and to find further properties. Moreover, we observed that the essential element for obtaining deep orbits solutions is special relativity. At a first glance, this fact results from an obvious algebraic property of the expression of energy levels obtained by the relativistic equations. Now, a comparative analysis of the relativistic and of the non-relativistic Schr?dinger equation allows us to affirm that Special Relativity leads to the existence of EDOs because of the non-linear form of the relativistic expression for the total energy, which implies a relativistic non-linear correction to the Coulomb potential.","Deep electron levels, LENR, Relativistic quantum physics, Singular solutions",3270_BiberianJPjcondensedt.pdf,,45.0,63.0

At this occasion we highlight the difference of resolution of these problems between the relativistic Schr?dinger equation and the Dirac equation, which leads for this latter, to consider a modified Coulomb potential with finite value inside the nucleus. In the second part, we consider the specific work of Maly and Va?vra on deep orbits as solutions of the Dirac equation, the so-called Deep Dirac Levels (DDLs). As a result of some criticism about the matching conditions at the boundary, we verified their computation, but by using a more complete ansatz for the ""inside"" solution. We can confirm the approximate size of the mean radii ?r? of DDL orbits and that ?r? decreases when the Dirac angular quantum number k increases. This latter finding is a self-consistent result since (as distinct from the atomic-electron orbitals) the binding energy of the DDL electron increases (in absolute value) with k.

So we considered the works of Maly and Va?vra on the topic, the most complete solution available and one showing an infinite family of EDO solutions. In particular, we deeply analyzed their second of these papers, where they consider a finite nucleus and look for solutions with a Coulomb potential modified inside the nucleus. In the present paper, we quickly recall our analysis, verification, and extension of their results. Moreover, we answer to a recent criticism that the EDOs would represent negative energy states and therefore would not qualify as an answer to the questions posed by Cold Fusion results. We can prove, by means of a simple algebraic argument based on the solution process, that, while at the transition region, the energy of the EDOs are positive. Next, we deepen the essential role of Special Relativity as source of the EDOs, which we discussed in previous papers. But the central topic of our present study is an initial analysis of the magnetic interactions near the nucleus, with the aim of solving important physical questions: do the EDOs satisfy the Heisenberg Uncertainty relation (HUR)? Are the orbits stable? So, we examine some works related to the Vigier?Barut Model, with potentials including magnetic coupling. We also carried out approximate computations to evaluate the strength of these interactions and the possibilities of their answering some of our questions. As a first result, we can expect the HUR to be respected by EDOs, due to the high energies of the magnetic interactions near the nucleus. Present computations for stability do not yet give a plain result; we need further studies and tools based on QED to face the complexity of the near-nuclear region. For the creation of EDOs, we outline a possibility based on magnetic coupling.","Deep electron levels, LENR, Magnetic interactions, Relativistic quantum physics, Singular solutions",3272_BiberianJPjcondensedw.pdf,,270.0,289.0

When including the magnetic interactions near the nucleus, we observed a breakthrough in how to satisfy the Heisenberg Uncertainty Relation (HUR) for electrons confined near the nucleus, in a radial zone of only a few fm. Here we chose a different method, by directly facing the HUR for such confined electrons, from which we deduce the coefficient ? of these highly relativistic electrons. Then we show the effective Coulomb potential due to a relativistic correction, can maintain the electrons in containment. Next we resume and deepen our study of the effects of EM interactions near the nucleus. We first obtain computation results: though approximate, we can effectively expect high-energy resonances near the nucleus. These results should be confirmed by using QFT-based methods.","Confinement, Deep electron levels, Heisenberg uncertainty relation, Highly relativistic electrons, LENR, Magnetic interaction, Relativistic quantum physics",3273_BiberianJPjcondensedy.pdf,,59.0,73.0

Cathodes were loaded with deuterium at a few 10?s of milliamps/cm^2, with a 12-hour cryogenic treatment at day 17. Cathodes were sanded and replaced in the cell every 7 days. On the ~21st & 22nd days two successive fast neutron episodes were observed at about 2 times background. The neutron detector is minimally sensitive to gamma rays but gammas were observed near the end of the 20-hour neutron episode. When the cells were dismantled in late Sept 1992, all three cathodes (6 mm diameter x 60 mm long) were observed to be mildly radioactive. Analysis by germanium gamma detectors revealed presence of 100 billion atoms of Ag, Pd, Rh, and (one) Ru isotopes having ratios unlike those from bombardment by high-energy deuteron or proton beams.","neutron, gamma emission",3304_PassellTOradiationd.pdf,,,

The EPRI program began in April, 1 989, and has continued to the present time attempting to replicate the claimed excess heat and determine its source. Under conditions difficult to achieve, some 16 separate experiments have successfully reached that goal out of some 35 major attempts. The conditions found necessary for an observation of excess heat were found to be at least three in number: 1) atomic loading ratio (DlPd) > -0.9; 2) Initiation time of 8 to 23 days; 3) current density >0. 1 amperes per cm^2 of cathode area. A fourth condition suggested by the results of a recent experiment is that the FLUX of deuterium across the palladium metal surface must be above some threshold value. No definitive source for the excess heat has been yet robustly determined, but measurable helium-4 has been observed in the cell vapor space in a few cases. The major evidence that the heat may be from nuclear reactions is its magnitude - some 10 to 100 times larger than any known chemical reaction. The objective of the continuing effort is focussed upon identifying the source of the excess heat. Sonic cavitation at a Pd-D2O interface has apparently produced both He-4 in the vapor phase as well as apparent excess heat. This research has identified a huge matrix of possible experiments to confirm or refute various hypotheses on the source of the heat. To acquire sufficient resources to explore this matrix requires, in my opinion, a definitive signature of a nuclear reaction connected with the production of heat. Then and only then, with the promise of a potential energy source of almost unlimited size, will the necessary research funds be forthcoming.","review, EPRI, Wolf, gamma emission, radioactivity, D2O, Pd ICCF-5, effect of H2O",3305_PonsSproceedinga.pdf,,410.0,425.0

The EPRI program began in April, 1989, and has successfully confinned the presence of the claimed excess heat but has yet to determine its source.

The major evidence that the heat may be from nuclear reactions is its magnitude - some 10 to 100 times larger than any known chemical reaction. The objective of the continuing effort is to identify the source of the excess heat. This paper focusses upon comparing measurements on cathodes that successfully produced excess heat with the same measurements on virgin material from the same batch of palladium. Initial measurements on one cathode that produced 0.56 megajoules of excess heat and its virgin counterpart are reported here. The analytical method chosen is a non destructive one known as prompt gamma activation analysis (PGAA) using thennal n~utrons in beams from research reactors. Since almost every isotope captures neutrons with the emission of several gamma rays unique to that isotope, any isotopic ratio changes from the heat production process will be converted to a change in the relative ratios of gamma ray intensities. Such ratios can be measured to an accuracy in the range around 1 % using high resolution gennanium detection systems. Thus any changes due to the production or loss of any isotope present can be detected and related to the excess heat produced. One such measurement using PGAA appears to show an -18% reduction in the ratio of boron-l 0 to palladium-l05 in the active cathode relative to the ratio in virgin material. Conventional explanations of this result such as selective chemical leaching of boron by the electrolyte are currently being tested.","Pd, boron, theory, ICCF-6",3307_NEDOthesixthin.pdf,,297.0,305.0

Of particular interest are cathodes and particulate Pd which had experienced episodes of excess heat production beyond all electrical and other inputs. This paper details the careful analysis by neutron activation analysis (NAA) of a set of three samples of finely powdered Pd exposed to high deuterium pressures (hundreds of atmospheres) near room temperature at the core of hollow cylindrical Pd cathodes. A fourth sample of unused Pd powder from the same batch used in the cathodes was analyzed as a control. The most prominent change observed in the three active samples versus the virgin Pd was the Zn-64 content. The active samples showed an increase in the Zn-64 isotope of 6 to 14 times that in the virgin Pd. Speculation regarding the source of this increased zinc varies from contamination during electron beam welding (used to seal off the hollow core) to nuclear reactions generated by high pressure deuterium gas on the large surface area Pd particles in the core.,"Pd, transmutation, D2O, D2, ICCF-8",3309_PassellTOtraceeleme.pdf,,,

Sci.,15,http://lenr-canr.org/acrobat/BiberianJPjcondensedn.pdf#page=295,2018-01-18,"Evidence is cited from the research literature on metals containing absorbed deuterium supporting the hypothesis that the excess heat episodes observed over the past 25 years are the result of exothermic deuteron stripping reactions with atomic nuclei of the absorbing metal. The deuteron stripping reaction is one in which the neutron half of the mass 2 deuteron is captured by an atomic nucleus while the proton half of the deuteron is ejected, repelled by the coulomb field of the positively charged metal nucleus. This hypothesis provides a plausible explanation why so little external radiation accompanies the episodes of excess heat first observed by Fleischmann and Pons [1]. The reaction products from stable isotopes of the host metal are a proton with energies up to 9.2 MeV energy and a recoiling nucleus with energies of 100?to 600 keV. These two reaction products are retained near their birthplace because their range in solids is less than 100 m. The emitted proton is energetic enough to produce by (p,n), (p, ), (p,T), and (p,X-ray), reactions with host metal nuclei and their light-element impurities, the small number of neutrons, alpha particles, tritium atoms (T), and X-rays, occasionally observed associated with deuterated Ti and Pd. The PIXE process (proton induced X-ray emission) is expected in which numerous K, L, and M X-rays of the absorbing metal are produced. For metals with thicknesses of >1 mm the vast majority of such X-rays do not escape the metal. In experiments with foils of the host metal sufficiently thin, low levels of charged particles (mostly protons) have been observed. Some of the observed protons were at energies larger than 3.0 MeV, the largest possible energy of protons from the fusion of two deuterons. Widely observed He4 and tritium are known products of the deuteron stripping reaction with Li6, which is a major constituent of electrolytes and a minor impurity in most metals. In any case, researchers have observed small but definite indicators of nuclear reactions other than d+d fusion in deuterated metals at temperatures not significantly above ambient.","Deuterium, Energy, Metals, Nuclear, Oppenheimer?Phillips",3315_BiberianJPjcondensedn.pdf,,295.0,301.0

Such radiation, however, is not detectable from outside of a standard electrochemical cell due to absorption in the electrolyte and cell walls. A custom cell was therefore assembled which permits X-rays of energy > 1 keV to pass through a thin cathodic membrane and enter into an X-ray detector with minimal attenuation. This test cell geometry also potentially allows any emitted MeV alpha particles to be detected when they impact a Pd cathode and cause fluorescent emission of Pd-K  (21.2, 23.8 keV) X-rays. The detection of X-ray emissions from a membrane electrolytic cell potentially permits the mechanism(s) for anomalous heat production to be investigated with great sensitivity. As an example, a typical X-ray detector allows 1 keV X-rays to be detected at emission rates of less than one per second and this level of sensitivity corresponds to a thermal resolution of < 0.2 fW. Time resolved X-ray spectral data ranging from 1 to 30 keV was collected for over a year using various types of membranes and different electrolytic solutions. None of these test cells, however, yielded any X-rays which were above ambient background levels.","Anomalous heat effect, Electrolytic cell, Low energy, PdD cathode, X-rays",3319_BiberianJPjcondensedr.pdf,,265.0,271.0

These outcomes will be shown to be compatible with the results and evidences obtained from low energy nuclear reaction experiments. Some theoretical concepts and ideas, on which our experiments are grounded, will be sketched and it will be shown that, in order to trigger our measured effects, it exists an energy threshold, that has to be overcome, and a maximum interval of time for this energy to be released to the nuclear system. Eventually, a research hypothesis will be put forward about the chance to raise the level of analogy from the mere comparison of results up to the phenomenological level.

As far as the gravitation, electromagnetic and weak interactions are the same in both of kind crystals, this only changes the residual strong interaction. Therefore, we conclude that the renormalization of the energy of electromagnetic excitations (electrons, excitons, and phonons) is carried out by the residual strong nuclear interaction. The necessity to take into account the more close relation between quantum chromodynamics and quantum electrodynamics is underlined. In the first step quantum electrodynamics should take into account the residual strong interaction at the description of the dynamics of elementary excitations (electrons, excitons, and phonons) dynamics.","Excitons, Leptons, Quantum electrodynamics and chromodynamics, Quarks, Strong interaction",3347_BiberianJPjcondensedzb.pdf,,512.0,520.0

The change of the concentration of deuterium in mixed crystals LiHxD1-x determines the change in the distance between nucleons, which is directly manifested in the position of the phononless free exciton emission line in the low - temperature luminescence spectrum.

It has therefore been necessary to adopt a low cost approach; our solution has been to use the single compartment Dewar cell type calorimeters illustrated in Fig. 1 and we have maintained up to five of these cells in each of three specially constructed water baths (see Section 1 below). The same type of calorimeter has been used for blank measurements on the Pd-H, Pt-D, and Pt-H systems.","heat+, Pd, D2O, method., electrolysis, ICCF-1",3357_NCFIthefirstan.pdf,,20.0,62.0

We have then adopted the procedure of allowing the cells to boil to dryness. For these conditions the galvanostats are driven to the rail voltage (100 V) but the cell current is reduced to zero. We have then found that cells which contained D2O frequently remain at high temperatures (in the vicinity of 100?C) before cooling rapidly to the bath temperature. Cells containing H2O can also be driven to the boiling point but such cells cool immediately on terminating the experiments. This phenomenon has become known as ""Heat after Death"" (the death referring to cessation of polarisation). Calibrations of the cells for such conditions show the generation of high levels of enthalpy at zero enthalpy input. Methods of investigating such systems will be outlined.","heat+, Pd, D2O, ICCF-4, electrolysis",3361_PonsSheatafterd.pdf,,,

The titanium chips were cooled and loaded with deuterium at 77 K and then rapidly heated to 323 K. The rapid heating produces a large pressure increase inside the crystalline lattice of the host metal. An Event Timer/Counter (ETC) card was designed and developed which counted and kept a time distribution of the neutron pulses as they occurred from a helium-3 neutron counter embedded in a paraffin moderator [1]. The experiment produced copious neutron counts. During one cooling and heating cycle, over 2 million neutrons were counted over a 5 min time period. In subsequent cooling and heating cycles using the same titanium chips, significant neutron bursts were observed with diminishing counts after each subsequent cycle.

In a spherical bubble compression and until the bubble assumes a pancake collapse shape, a temperature increase does not occur in the bubble gas because the mean free path likely exceeds the bubble diameter. The subsequent collapse of the pancake shape to liquid density occurs with only a negligible volume change so that the temperature increase for compression heating of bubble gases is insignificant. Even near liquid density, a temperature increase does not occur as the energy transfer by molecular collisions is in the adiabatic limit for both vibrational and rotational modes. Instead, the IR radiation energy density present within the bubble is increased as required to satisfy standing wave boundary conditions with the bubble walls in the direction of collapse. For biological tissue in an opaque environment, bubble collapse is found to increase the 5- 10 micron I R thermal radiation at ambient temperature to about 3-5 e V that is capable of dissociating the water molecule and forming the chemically reactive hydroxyl radical. Hence, the biological effects of ultrasonic cavitation are proposed to be caused by the chemical reaction of the organisms with the excited electronic states of dissolved oxygen and water molecules.","ultrasound, biology, cavitation, radiation, ICCF-5",3409_PonsSproceedinga.pdf,,346.0,353.0

In August 1995 excess heat generation was observed in initial triode apparatus experiments conducted by Dr. Dennis Cravens in his New Mexico laboratory. In November 1995 the Boiler Works laboratory in Diamondhead began experimental evaluation of the triode apparatus. A series of experiments in December, January and February led to development of a functioning triode fusion reactor. The reactor was put into operation 20 March 1996 and operated continuously until 23 August 1996. Over the five months of operation of the reactor several experiments were preformed and over 65,000 data pOints were recorded.

An electrolytic cell with a Ni cathode and a Pt anode with an aqueous (H2O not D2O) solution of K2CO3 as electrolyte was used for the experiment. A dc-power supply capable of supplying up to 5 A current was used to drive the electrolysis with the typical current being around 4 A and the applied voltage about 100 V. After running the electrolysis for about two weeks with a daily run time of 8 h on an average, a part of the nickel electrode, which by this time had become black, was taken for elemental analysis using Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS). The EDS analysis showed that a whole host of new elements had appeared on the cathode such as: K, Fe, Cu, O, Rh, Zr and Pb. The apparent concentration of the elements varied from just over a percent for K and Pb to about 10% for Rh and 20% for Cu. The sample was then taken to a Time of Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometer (ToF-SIMS) for isotopic analysis. This analysis also showed that a set of new elements had appeared on the nickel wire which were: K, Si, Mg, Mn, Zn, O & Rh. The Ni itself was found to have the following isotopes: 58Ni, 60Ni and 62Ni with isotope concentration ratios differing significantly from the ratio found in naturally occurring Ni. It was clear that in the electrolyzed Ni the concentrations of 60Ni and 62Ni had gone down compared to the concentration of 58Ni. This is a clear indication that nuclear reactions had taken place during electrolysis.","Electrolysis, LENR, Ni?H systems, Transmutation",3456_BiberianJPjcondensedw.pdf,,290.0,295.0

This strange effect was distinctly confirmed by the observation that with the TiT0.0035-preparation the radioactivity decreased 12.5 times stronger than the release of tritium (2,3,4). A quite independent proof of the strong decrease of λ of tritium could be obtained by a thermodynamic evaluation of the heating experiment with the TiT0.0035-preparation: Assuming that λ of tritium decreases to zero or nearly zero in a part of the tritons enables the determination of the number of tritons with normal λ, nT and the number of tritons with λ ≈ 0 nTo, both as a function of temperature. Then quite surprising nT and nTo follow the laws of chemical equilibria in distinct parts of the experimental A = f(T)-function.

Phys. 7 (2005) 127] that states with binding energy and size below those of known literature values are incompatible with quantum mechanics is corrected by reviewing the analytically known Coulomb solution of the Klein-Gordon equation with binding energy of order mc2 and size of order of the Compton wavelength. This is an example of a quantum state, which is mathematically acceptable in the sense of being square integrable and having a finite binding energy but yet is rejected as unphysical due in part to the point-nucleus nature of the model. Then the Dirac equation is studied for the existence of states which are similarly mathematically acceptable but whose physical acceptability requires physical judgment. States of Landau symmetry are found which meet these criteria. The existence of states of ambiguous physical interpretation for both the Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations depends on using a point-nucleus versus a finite-nucleus potential model. On using a realistic model for the charge distribution of the proton, a Klein-Gordon state is found in the binding range of 5 keV, but no state is found for the Dirac equation.","Dirac equation, Hydrino states, Klein-Gordon equation",3497_BiberianJPjcondensedj.pdf,,106.0,127.0

The liquid in the cell is a solution including a silicate, a lithium salt, and a surfactant. The electrical stimuli are RF signals and, optionally, a direct current. The protocol generates an exothermic reaction characterized by sharp temperature transients. We have successfully used three different silicates and four different metals for electrodes. We believe the exothermic reaction is nuclear in nature. The evidence supporting that statement includes:? Data logs show brief, intense temperature transients.? Electron diffraction scattering (EDS) analyses show elements to be present after the reaction that could be transmutation products of several elements in the ingredients of the protocol, specifically including silver, a possible transmutation product of palladium.? Auger analysis of one experiment also shows evidence of transmutation of the elements in the reaction cell.? SEM photos show ""volcanic sites"" and other evidence of metal migration.?

The largest tritium generation rates observed were obtained with the glow discharge operating in a magnetic field, and were in the range 109-1010 atom/s. This is higher than our background by three to four orders of magnitude.

His goal was to answer two critical questions: Does cold fusion produce helium along with excess heat, like a plasma fusion reaction? And if so, does it produce roughly as much helium per joule of energy as a plasma fusion reaction does? He answers both questions affirmatively. When a cold fusion palladium cathode becomes active, it releases helium into the electrolyte. The helium leaves the cell in the effluent deuterium and oxygen gas. Cathodes that produced more excess heat produced greater amounts of helium. The ratio of helium to energy is roughly comparable to that of hot fusion, within an order of magnitude. This is strong evidence that cold fusion really is some form of nuclear fusion, and not fission, zero point energy, or something else.",history,3546_RothwellJintroducti.pdf,,,

"Rothwell, J.",2016,Cold Fusion Will Lower the Cost of both Energy and Equipment,ICCF20 International Conference on Condensed Matter Nuclear Science,,http://lenr-canr.org/acrobat/RothwellJcoldfusionb.pdf,2016-09-14,"Cold fusion will lower the cost of energy because the fuel costs nothing. It will also greatly reduce the cost of many machines, especially electric generators. The cost of generators is likely to fall by a factor of 200, from $2,000/kW to $10/kW, which is the cost difference between a power company central generator and a portable gasoline generator.A radical reduction in the cost of one device does not always reduce the cost of others. Since 1900, the cost of illumination has fallen by a factor of 80, but this has not directly reduced the cost of other goods and services by a similar factor. Since 1970, the cost of computer memory has fallen by a factor of 108. Microprocessors and cheap memory enhanced many products. They brought us the Internet and ubiquitous cheap computing. But so far they have not drastically lowered costs outside of computer applications. Cold fusion is different. All machines use energy, so cold fusion will lower the cost of everything, but it will have the biggest impact replacing large, expensive machines with small mass-produced versions. Other new sources of energy such as solar panels also have zero cost fuel, but they will not reduce the cost of other machines. Only cold fusion can do this.It follows that the most profitable use of cold fusion in the first decades after it is introduced will be to replace existing technology, rather than to make radical new technology. Microprocessors brought us machines we did not have, such as cell phones and the Internet. Cold fusion will ? at first ? dramatically lower the cost of machines we already have.",History,3573_RothwellJcoldfusionb.pdf,,,

Cold fusion does not produce carbon dioxide so if it replaces other sources of energy carbon emissions would stop.2.	Cold fusion can enhance the removal of carbon from the atmosphere by reforestation.Large scale reforestation projects have been proposed to remove carbon from the atmosphere and sequester it in trees. Cold fusion technology would greatly enhance such projects, increasing the amount of carbon by a factor of ten and reducing the cost of the project by a large factor. Cold fusion can be used to stop the natural boom and bust cycle of forest carbon, by burying charcoal made from deadwood underground.

It is conjectured the craters result from violent reactions, perhaps of nuclear origin. Nagel proposed acorrelation between the crater diameter and the energy involved in its formation. Starting from this assumption, it can be estimated that the enthalpy released can raise the temperature of the crater content to about 2000 K. A simple model is used to calculate the crater cooling by conduction and radiation. It gives the order of magnitude of the maximum event duration in order to achieve some melting of the cathode material. The duration of the eruption is estimated from the gas pressure developed within the crater. A value of 6 ns is obtained for a 2?m diameter, and 600 ns for a 20?m crater. In large craters, a part of inner material can be molten.

The conditions of temperature and COP to achieve self-sustaining operation are given. According to the literature, the heat generation rate of some LENR processes increases rapidly with the temperature. This phenomenon dictates the cooling criteria to maintain a stable reactor operation. Power control can be obtained through appropriate temperature regulation. Several types of heat engines can be coupled to LENR reactors with appropriate power control. Heat losses must be minimized with sufficient  thermal insulation. The insulation enclosure is also useful to recover the leaks of light gas, if any are present in the system.","Gas leakage, Heat engines, Power control, Runaway, Self-sustaining, Stability, Thermal insulation",3601_BiberianJPjcondensedu.pdf,,12.0,31.0

Sci.,23,http://lenr-canr.org/acrobat/BiberianJPjcondensedv.pdf#page=32,2017-05-22,"Hot spots are small features that some authors suppose are created by a sudden local release of thermal energy. For example, the estimation of the energy involved in the formation of a 2 ?m crater is 3 ? 10-8 J or 2 ? 105 MeV. Some theories attempting to explain these phenomena, and excess heat in general, involve the role of Exotic Neutral Particles (ENP), like Polyneutrons or Erzions. According to such theories, these ENPs are relatively rare. The problem investigated in this paper is whether a single particle may trigger a series of many reactions within a short time in solids that are properly loaded. A Monte-Carlo simulation has been written to study the potential behavior of ENPs. It is shown that the ENPs follow a developed and Brownian type movement. The number of reactions occurring at a given depth below the surface is calculated, as well as the probability for a series to exceed a given value. From a pure mathematical viewpoint, a parallel can be made between the diffusion laws and Brownian motion. It is shown that a small fraction of the ENP flux can trigger large series of reaction, to the point that the energy that can be produced is not limited if the ENP is stable as long as it is present in the lattice. It is necessary to introduce a limited lifetime with a decay to reconcile the model with the experimental observations. The discussion of the simulation results in the light of experimental data leads me to propose a mean free path on the order of 100 ?, and a lifetime in the nanosecond range.","Brownian motion, Exotic neutral particles, Hot spots, Monte-Carlo, Particle lifetime, Simulation",3602_BiberianJPjcondensedv.pdf,,32.0,49.0

The violence of the explosion was surprising. We decided to re-analyze this event. The examination of the cell remnants indicate that the explosion occurred in the gas phase, and the electrodes seem unaffected. The stoichiometric H2?O2 mix can explode following different mechanisms that are briefly reviewed. A particular phenomenon called Shock Wave Amplification by Coherent Energy Release (SWACER) is able to produce strong detonations. A gas quantity similar to the original cell ignited by a hot spot or a spark produces only weak explosions that do not break the glass tube. Strong detonations are reproducibly obtained with a setup designed to induce the SWACER. The re-analysis of the event shows that the explosion was probably triggered by the SWACER resulting from a reaction in the hollow Pd cathode. In order to avoid accidents in the future during the operation of closed electrolytic cells, it is advised in addition to the conventional safety measures to avoid the presence of hollow, gas-filled metallic pieces in the reactor gas space, like a tube or a folded sheet.","Deflagration, Detonation, Electrolytic cell, Explosion, Pd cathode, SWACER",3603_BiberianJPjcondensedy.pdf,,81.0,102.0

In the Air Flow Calorimetry method (AFC), the fluid is air. AFC appears to be a relatively simple method to measure the amount of heat produced by an LENR reactor. It is well suited when the LENR reactor surface temperature is high. It is easier to build than mass flow calorimeters using water-cooled or oil-cooled systems. Basically, the calorimeter is designed such that all the heat produced by the device under test is transferred to a known mass flow of cooling air. The accuracy of the method is governed by the control of the heat losses, the mass flow-rate of cooling air, the air heat capacity, the measure of the average air temperatures at inlet and outlet. Transpiration cooling is an efficient design to minimize the heat losses. The AFC method can be applied to reactors of any size and surface temperature. Its use is restricted to the testing of reactors that work continuously, because thermal equilibrium must be reached to make valid measurements. A thorough calibration procedure is essential to minimize the influence of errors on mass flows and temperature differences.","Air flow calorimetry, Air heat capacity, Calibration, Flow meters, Heat measurement, High temperature, Transpiration cooling, Craters , Explosion, LENR, Melting",3605_BiberianJPjcondensedzf.pdf,,258.0,273.0

The potential penetration of LENR energy is analyzed taking into account the different conversion routes between the primary energy sources and the final industrial and domestic users.

In this connection Prof. Peter Hagelstain writes in [ 1 ] : ""Some say that this heat can be explained easily by elementary chemical reactions, phase changes, or battery-like storage effects. I have trouble with these explanations"" . For instance, nickel electrolysis in light water produces the same amount of energy as that of palladium in heavy water. Besides, we have to consider a no less mysterious phenomenon of sonoluminescence, that was discovered in Russia in 1 933 by S.N.Rzhevkin. At first sight these phenomena seem to bear no correlation. But Julian Schwinger, the Nobel Laureate and profound research worker, has drawn parallels between cold fusion and sonoluminescence in his continuous technical publication on both topics. He notes in [2] : ""Like Cold Fusion, sonoluminescence ""should not exist"", but it does. This now wellestablished phenomenon occurs when ultrasonic sound, beamed into liquid, causes bubbles to oscillate stably - to expand and contract regularly - and also to emit regular pulses of light"".","theory, ICCF-5",3656_PonsSproceedinga.pdf,,164.0,169.0

One did not pay any serious attention to that phenomenon. And only in the recent works of Paulo and Alexandra Correa it was shown that by creation of the conditions for abnormal gas discharge (PAGD - Pulsed Abnormal Glow Discharge) on direct current powerful bursts of alternating current appear. The energy of these bursts exceeds several times the consumed energy (up to 10 times). In this experiment one can observe that a part of electric current carriers (obviously electrons) gain high velocities being the reason for excess energy generation. According to the unitary quantum theory it possible to explain easily the generation of excess energy [1, 7, 8]. The electrons can oscillate with a high plasma frequency relatively to very heavy positive ions. Their behaviour is possible to explain as oscillations in a potential well with the rims of various height. A t some certain values of initial phase the approximate equation of the unitary quantum theory with an oscillating charge can yield the ""mathernily home"" solution [1,7,8]. As a result of the electrones having gained a high energy with a high velosity they fly out of the wells, and always in one direction. It is the energy generation process - and not nuclear reactions - that are responsible for excess energy creation. The mathematical process model is created as well as an approximate solution of the non-linear difforential equation is achieved. The range of values of initial phases allowing the energy generation process is determined. If the experimental research of Tesla, Tandberg and Correa are correct then there is no doubt the foture power industry would be developing in this direction and not in today's fashionable direction of the cold nuclear fusion.","gas discharge, theory, ICCF-7",3660_ENECOtheseventh.pdf,,472.0,477.0

The effect of surface morphology on electrochemical reaction kinetics is well described in the literature 1 therefore it seems to be reasonable to assume that the surface morphology of the cathodes could play a role in the electrochemical metal-hydride formation. Actually, a wide variety of surface features and profiles have been observed in the Pd cathodes typically employed in excess heat production experiments. These features are noted in both the as-prepared samples and the electrolyzed ones. In order to establish a correlation between the occurrence of a particular surface morphology and calorimetric results, it is necessary to identify a useful metric with which to describe and compare the different surface morphologies.

The MS revealed that the tungsten isotopes transmutated into elements lighter than tungsten, higher post-experimental intensity of mass numbers 169, 170, 171, 178 and 180 being observed. The mass spectra peaks magnituded for isotopes lighter than W isotopes increased by factors ranging from 5 to 400. The registered increase varied from 5-50 cps in the original foils to 100-20 000 cps after the exposure to deuterium GD. Lighter isotopes in tungsten and tantalum foils placed on the GD cathode after deuterium GD exposure were identified using high resolution gamma/X-ray spectrometry. The comparison of thermal ionization mass-spectrometry (TIMS) data and data of gamma-spectra energy peaks allowed to assume that the peaks series observed in gamma spectra belong to the following isotopes: 169 70 Yb, 170 72 Hf , 171m 70 Yb, 172 72 Hf and 178 70 Yb. Correlation of TIMS and Gamma spectrometry data leads to the assumption that the appearance of light isotopes in tungsten resulted from the low-energy decay process initiation caused by deuterium GD.","Isotopic ratio change, Low-energy gas glow discharge, Mass-spectrometry, Palladium, Transmutation, Tungsten",3688_BiberianJPjcondensede.pdf,,190.0,207.0

On the other hand, a small number of theoreticians, who are working on the physics of the magnetic monopole, know that the nuclear reaction of the zero incident energy proceeds when the system involves a magnetic monopole. Since the former group still lacks a theory of the nuclear cold fusion based on the first principle of the natural law, I believe it is fruitful to explain to the former group how the theoretician of the particle physics comes to arrive at the conclusion that the nuclear cold fusion must occur if a magnetic monopole exists, in the framework of the quantum theory.","Change of penetration factor, Charge quantization condition, Magnetic monopole, Nuclear cold fusion, Origin of nonreproducibility",3689_BiberianJPjcondensed.pdf,,12.0,16.0

The first time this was suggested was in the Spring of 1989, ten years ago, by Fleischmann and Pons (1): their experiment gave rise to much turmoil all over the world, ending within a few months with the scientific community rejecting the experiment and thus this interpretation. Research in CF continued nevertheless in a few laboratories, mostly in the USA, Japan, Italy, Russia and China; International Conferences were held regularly, roughly every 1.5 years. However, after ten years, in spite of undeniable (although not overwhelming) progress in the field, there is hardly any communication between this small CF community and the scientific world at large.",,3696_Scaramuzzitenyearsof.pdf,,,

The aim of the present study was to analyze the time courses of the signals of one of the experiments using an advanced signal-processing framework. The experiment was a high temperature (375 K), high pressure (750 kPa) and long-term (866 h . 35 days) electrochemical transmutation exploration done in 2008. The analysis was performed by (i) selecting the intervals of the D/Pd, T and P signals where the daily oscillations occurred, (ii) filtering the signals to remove low-frequency noise, (iii) analyzing the waveforms of the daily oscillations, (iv) applying Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) to decompose the signals into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs), (v) performing a statistical test on the obtained IMFs in order to identify the physically most meaningful oscillation mode, (vi) performing an power spectral analysis, (vii) calculating the correlations between the signals, and (viii) determining the time-dependent phase synchronization between the signals. We found that (i) in all three signals (D/Pd, T and P) a clear daily oscillation was present while the current density J did not show such an oscillation, (ii) the daily oscillation in T and P had similar waveforms and where anti-correlated to the oscillation in D/Pd, (iii) D/Pd and T had the highest correlation (r = 0.7693), (iv) all three signals exhibited phase synchronization over the whole signal length while the strongest phase synchronization took place between D/Pd and T . Possible origins of the daily oscillation were discussed and implications for further investigations and experiments were outlined.","Daily oscillations, Diurnal oscillations, Electrochemical transmutation, Ensemble empirical mode decomposition, Intrinsic mode functions, Low-energy nuclear reactions, Phase synchronization, Signal correlating",3721_BiberianJPjcondensedg.pdf,,43.0,54.0

My reason for emphasizing this point was that, as opposed to situations associated with maintaining comparable standards in clinical trials, in which existing funding levels allow for the possibility that particular experiments will be repeated, in biomedical research, one cannot obtain funding to repeat research experiments that are large and expensive. For this reason, it was (and has remained) imperative that instances of possible fraud, misconduct and sloppy work be reduced from the outset. Because of limited funding, as a consequence, the self-correcting process of science may not be operative in these areas. I then used to end this part of my discussion by citing how in cold fusion research, and because of the potential significance and impact of the particular claims associated with this area, the self-correcting nature of science worked. The cold fusion experiments have been repeated dozens of times without success. The conclusion was that they were proven to be wrong.

The absorption of deuterium by Ti is a reversible process and when titanium is heated in a deuterium atmosphere, the reaction will continue until the concentration of deuterium in the metal attains an equilibrium value. This equilibrium value depends on the specimen temperature and the pressure of the surrounding deuterium atmosphere. Any imposed temperature or pressure change causes rejection or absorption of deuterium until a new equilibrium state is achieved. If the surface of titanium is clean, the rate of absorption increases rapidly with temperature. At temperatures above 500?C, the equilibrium is achieved in a matter of a few seconds. However deuterium absorption is considerably reduced if the surface of Ti is contaminated with oxygen. Keeping in view these facts, a procedure was evolved for titanium target preparation and subsequent deuteration. The following sections describe the details of preparation of the targets, their chemical cleaning and degassing followed by deuteration process.","Ti, loading",3802_Shrikhandedeuteratio.pdf,,,

Deuterium loading is carried out in a series of steps by passing a D.C. current to ohmically heat the sample for some time in D2 gas until a measurable quantity is absorbed. After every loading, the wire resistance and decrease in the gas pressure are measured at room temperature using a four probe resistance meter (?0.2% accuracy) and an oil manometer respectively.Significantly, it is observed that an apparently simple property like electrical resistance is not easily reproducible. The pre loading heat treatment and residual gases in high vacuum appear to play an important role on the behaviour of the resistance in TiDx. The preliminary results also suggest that this property may not be useful in estimating the deuterium content in titanium.","TiD, resistance, resistivity, ICCF-5",3803_PonsSproceedinga.pdf,,270.0,273.0

A dead?time filtering technique was employed to detect the presence of neutron ""bursts"" if any and characterize the multiplicity distribution of such neutron bursts. It was found that with an operating Pd?D2O cell located in the centre of the neutron detection set?up, the daily average neutron count rate increased by about 9% throughout a one month period, over the background value of ~ 2386 counts/day indicating an average daily neutron production of ~ 2220 neutrons/day by the cell. In addition analysis of the dead?time filtered counts data indicated that about 6.5% of these neutrons were emitted in the form of bursts of 20 to 100 neutrons each. On an average there were an additional 6 burst events per day during electrolysis with LiOD over the daily average background burst rate of 1.7 bursts/day.

As a consequence, the localized phonon modes of the crystal/damaged-region interface have a much higher frequency than the host. These high-frequency modes create electrostatic fields that interact strongly with electrons of the local atoms. A resulting instantaneous potential inversion, from polarization, leads to the formation of lochons (local charged bosons-electron pairs in the singlet state, perhaps isolated from the Pd d-orbital energy levels) and of an associated H+ or D+ ion (with its two shared electrons instantaneously isolated into the adjacent Pd d-levels). The Coulomb repulsion between the nuclei of these pairs is greatly reduced by strong screening from the lochons that can even generate an attractive polarization potential. Furthermore, the mutual tunneling penetration probability of the Coulomb barrier is enhanced by correlated fluctuations. This arises from the generalized uncertainty relations, x px,E t = (n + 1/2)h/(1 - ?2)0.5, where n may be on the order of 10-100 and where results from two models are combined. The integer n values represent excitations in the phonon modes of the H or D sub-lattice and ? is the correlation coefficient with 0 < ? < 1. Higher values of nand ?, for a particle in a potential well, imply less localization and greater uncertainties in location (i.e., extending its probability distribution further into the barrier). These periodic fluctuations into the barrier are an interference effect similar to that of beat frequencies.","Bond polarization, Correlated fluctuations, Lattice-assisted tunneling, LENR, Phonons",3818_BiberianJPjcondensedg.pdf,,111.0,120.0

Such non-equilibrium defects can exist only in a solid matrix.? Further, solids harbor lattice vibrational modes (quanta, phonons) whose longitudinal-optical modes interact strongly with electrons and ions.? One such interaction, resulting in potential inversion, causes localization of electron pairs on deuterons. Thus, we have attraction of D+ - D- pairs and strong screening of the nuclear repulsion due to these local electron pairs (local charged bosons: acronym, lochons).? This attraction and strong coupling permits low-energy deuterons to approach close enough to alter the standard equations used to define nuclear-interaction cross-sections.

This non-uniformity results in phonon modes that are localized and of higher frequency than for unloaded lattices. These modes create dynamic electrostatic fields that couple strongly with both bound and free electrons and the hydrogen (H and D) sub-lattice. A consequent potential inversion leads to the formation of ""lochons"" (local-charged bosons-electron pairs in the singlet state) and results in H- or D- ions in the sub-lattice. The nuclear-Coulomb repulsion between colliding D+ D- ion pairs in the sub-lattice is considerably reduced by the resultant ""strong screening"" and ""lochon-drag"" effects. Furthermore, work is done, by the bound lochon in a D- ion attracting an adjacent D+ ion. This results in reductions: of the deuteron?s electron-orbital radii, as the ion pair approaches; of the mass deficit between the deuteron pair and a 4He atom (or a proton pair and a 2He/2H atom); and finally of the Coulomb repulsion between nuclear protons in a helium nucleus. Thus, the end product of such a deuteron-pair fusion is an excited-helium nucleus (4He*) with lower energy relative to that resulting from energetic deuteron collisions. This reduced energy of the excited nucleus may be lower than its new fragmentation levels. The effect of lochon mediation, to alter the nuclear potential-well and fragmentation energies, allows decay to the 4He ground states to be free of particulate radiation. This decay process, of ""neutral"" 2He (from p+p) or 4He excited nuclei, is also a basis for observed transmutation.","Deep orbital, Fragmentation, LENR, Lochon, Strong screening",3824_BiberianJPjcondensede.pdf,,64.0,72.0

The control cells used copper(II) chloride, lithium chloride, and D2O electrolyte. Experimental and control cells were supplied current, increasing from 0.1 to 100.0 mA over a period of 20 days. For test days 9 through 20, the standard configuration experimental cells exhibited significantly higher average neutron radiation than the controls at a 99% confidence level.

In the first method the multiplicity distribution of counts in 20 ms time intervals is analysed to give information about the statistics of neutron emission in cold fusion. The results of six such experiments indicate that about 10 to 25% of the neutrons produced in cold fusion are emitted in the form of bunches 400 to 600 neutrons each. The other method discussed is an adaptation of the Artificial Dead Time method developed originally for reactor noise analysis as well as for the passive neutron assay of plutonium. An expression for the fractional loss of counts in the presence of dead time is derived. It is shown that a neutron detection efficiency of ~ 1% is adequate to estimate the average multiplicity as well as the fraction of bunched neutron emission in the presence of a Poisson background.,"neutron, critique, method, ICCF-1",3860_Srinivasanstatistica.pdf,,,

It was estimated that about 108 to 1010 tritium generating lenr reactions take place in these hot spots accompanied by a very small fraction of neutrons. During the last few years several researchers have reported detecting a variety of transmutation reaction products in localized sites, often associated with some type of crater formation. Other experimenters have reported online detection of flashes of ""thermal hot spots"" in their cathodes. It is therefore tempting to speculate that perhaps the concept of micro-nuclear explosions can be extended to heat generating helium producing reactions too, as well as nuclear reactions responsible for transmutation products. Many theoretical models such as those that depend on the catalyzing role of some exotic intermediate agent (such as Bose-Einstein condensates, deuteron clusters, Erzions, poly neutrons, trapped neutrons etc) seem to point to the possibility of occurrence of chain events. Two decades into the CMNS era, it is therefore worthwhile reexamining the merits of the micro-nuclear explosion hypothesis and seek independent experimental evidence to either corroborate or refute such a hypothesis.",,3867_ViolanteVproceedinga.pdf,,57.0,62.0

Among the many findings of the BARC groups were the first hint of the neutron to tritium branching ratio anomaly, namely that tritium production is several orders of magnitude higher than that of neutrons, that neutrons and tritium are probably being emitted simultaneously and that at least in the case of titanium targets, the generated tritium is found to be entrenched in highly localized ""hot spots"". But the most intriguing observation of all was that neutrons appeared to be emitted in sharp bursts of up to 10^3 neutrons per event. An integrated view of all these findings taken together led to the speculation that perhaps up to 10^10-10^12 tritons each were being generated in the form of micro-nuclear explosions, with neutron emission being only a minor side reaction in the process. Whatever the nature of the phenomenon, it seemed to be occurring in a highly localized fashion, both in space and time. Since those early days however the aspect of spatially localized occurrence of nuclear reactions has gained further acceptance through the concept of ""Nuclear Active Environment"". The observation of thermal hot spots, micro-craters and isolated regions wherein transmutation products are concentrated on the cathode surface has reinforced the suspicion that the phenomenon is spatially localized. But how reliable is the evidence for localization in time? This review revisits our early neutron multiplicity measurements since it appears that confirmation of multiple neutron production is possibly the only handle we have to establish the temporal localization feature and thereby give some insight into the possible occurrence of micro-nuclear explosions which in turn would have a tremendous bearing on the nature of the theoretical mechanism governing these LENR reactions.","Hot spots, Micro-nuclear explosion, Neutron bursts, Statistics, Tritium",3870_BiberianJPjcondensedc.pdf,,169.0,180.0

Electrolytic, gas and plasma loading techniques were deployed. Post run electrolyte samples were analyzed for tritium content using standard liquid scintillation techniques. In the case of gas and plasma loaded ""dry"" samples, surface tritium content was measured directly using windowless beta counters. Autoradiography was deployed as a very effective tool to monitor the spatial distribution of tritium in the near surface layers of test samples. The first confirmation of copious tritium generation was obtained on 21 April 1989 in a commercial ""Milton Roy"" Pd?D2O electrolytic cell. The results obtained during the first year of the BARC Cold Fusion campaign were presented at ICCF 1 in March 1990 where we reported observing tritium generation in 22 different electrolytic cells, which were set up totally independently by diverse research groups.

The produced neutrons can then initiate low energy nuclear reactions through further nuclear transmutations. The aim of this paper is to extend and enlarge on various examples analyzed previously, present simplified order-of-magnitude estimates for each and illuminate a common unifying theme among them.

The change in temperature was forced on the electrolysis cell while it was producing nuclear energy at excess power levels of 240?W/cm3 and after producing a continuous excess heat amount of 150?MJ/cm3 (14?000?eV/atom of Pd). The temperature change (from 82.5??C to ~0??C) resulted in a total loss of excess power (nuclear power) and indicates the regions of the microstructure that were ordered superabundant vacancy (SAV) phase transformed from d to the ordered superabundant vacancy phase d'. The d phase is responsible for producing excess heat and power while the d' phase produces no excess heat or power. Deuterium in the d phase occupies the octahedral sites but occupies the tetrahedral sites in the d' phase. In either case, d and d' are minor phases with volume fractions in the two-phase microstructure of approximately 0.03 and 5.0 percent for d and d', respectively.

The following conclusions result from the work:1. Palladium, no matter how well prepared, is very inhomogeneous with respect to the properties relevant to cold fusion. Therefore, most general conclusions can not be based on the behavior of one or a few samples.2. The bulk properties do not represent the properties of the nuclear-active-regions. Theoreticians need to take special note of this observation.3. Energy active palladium will continue to produce excess energy even after being subjected to acid treatment or physical removal of the surface. Therefore, ""good"" palladium is difficult to ruin.4. A pretest method has been developed to identify ""good"" palladium.","Pd, loading, heat, D2O, electrolysis, ICCF-6",3911_StormsEsomethough.pdf,,,

The influence of these properties on the ability to produce excess power from the ""Pons-Fleischmann"" effect was explored.The palladium was found to be very nonuniform with respect to the measured properties. Excess power production was associated with a minimum amount of excess volume and an open circuit voltage above 1.0 V.

Fortunately for the future of mankind, several new but controversial sources of energy have been discovered. This talk will describe a method to initiate nuclear reactions within solid materials, so-called Chemically Assisted Nuclear Reactions (CANR) when the environment is the focus or Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR) if the process is to be emphasized. Proposed is a new field of study which combines the electron environment (chemistry) with the nuclear environment (nuclear physics), two environments which are thought not to interact. The method generates energy without producing serious amounts of radiation or radioactive waste. In addition, the method is suggested as a means to reduce the radioactivity associated with previously generated nuclear waste.

These clusters are proposed to hide their Coulomb barrier and to react with isolated deuterons to produce fusion and to react with larger nuclei to produce transmutation. Members of the cluster not directly involved in the nuclear reaction might be scattered by the released energy, thereby allowing momentum to be conserved and the resulting energy to produce particles having energy too small to be easily detected or to cause easily detectable secondary reactions.? Justification of this model is discussed. This proposed model is consistent with most observations, but raises additional questions about the nature of such super-clusters and other ways the energy may be communicated directly to the lattice that will be addressed in future papers.",,3958_StormsEroleofclus.pdf,,,

Sufficient evidence is now available to justify believing this is a real phenomenon and not the result of error. The challenge is to explain how such an unusual process operates.

Efforts are now underway to go the next step on this path to nuclear sources by harnessing fusion power using hydrogen. So far, this so-called hot fusion process has not been successful in producing practical power. The complexity and size of the generator is expected to make this source impractical even after the many engineering problems are solved. Perhaps a different approach is needed. As answer to this need, a new method called cold fusion was recently discovered to cause fusion. Even though this might prove to be a better way to extract fusion energy, the claim has been difficult for some scientists to accept because it conflicts with what is known about nuclear interaction.

A great deal of effort has been applied to understanding how this can be accomplished and the nature of the resulting structure. The bulk properties play a role in this process but are sensitive to the impurity content and treatment. The influence of the bulk properties on this process has not been fully explored.This paper describes a new method to directly measure the bond energy between the PdH structure and the contained H atoms in real time as a function of H/Pd ratio from zero to the maximum H content using the electrolytic method and H2SO4+H2O to react Pd with H. A unique and very accurate calorimeter (+/-5 mW) is used to measure power during the loading reaction. This method is applied to several types of Pd including commercial Pd sheet, extra pure Pd, and a zone refine single-crystal of Pd after each is subjected to several treatments. These treatments include repeated loading-deloading cycles, annealing at 900?C, and reduction in thickness. The bond energy is found to be sensitive to purity, treatment, and H/Pd ratio, with good agreement with published measurements being achieved after certain treatments. In addition, three methods to measure the average H/Pd ratio are described and compared. These methods use weight gain, orphaned oxygen, and recombiner temperature. A great deal of information about the reaction process can be obtained by combining these three methods because they are sensitive to different possible errors and behaviours.","loading, excess heat",3982_StormsEtheenthalp.pdf,,,

Nuclear accidents would no longer be a worry. We now know that if this clean energy had been developed 31 years ago, future global warming would have been reduced.

The laboratory was attempting to develop fission power for use in space, which is a very difficult problem.  In fact, having sufficient power for extended space travel is still a problem. The power produced by cold fusion could be the ideal solution. As result, people at Los Alamos became very exited.

The immense potential energy benefits of CF were immediately recognized at the time. Humankind?s need for a source of cheap, clean, inexhaustible, and safe energy seemed to be realized. However, CF was rejected by mainstream science within a year or so, and it remains highly marginalized to this day. On the other hand, it has continued to be rigorously pursued by many capable investigators in several countries. It is now widely referred to as Low Energy Nuclear Reaction (LENR)Many of the investigators who continued to pursue LENR in spite of the rejection began their work in the early years after the announcement. Now more than 30 years later many are leaving the field because of retirement or health issues. Because of the rejection and lack of funding, the researchers? records have not been systematically recorded and preserved. At the same time, these records may eventually help understand LENR and achieve its benefits.

The knowledge gained from 43 experiments reported on in this paper were completed in the period of Feb. to Apr. of 1 998. The energy values for Q(x) and Q(a) outputs vary from 40 KJ to mega Joules with rates that vary from 1 to 1 5 watts depending on the conditions. The one parameter that is not predictable at this point is the duration of Q(a).","cavitation, ultrasonic, heat+, ICCF-7",3998_ENECOtheseventh.pdf,,361.0,365.0

We have adapted it for our use.  The transient cavitation bubble, TCB, has been harnessed to produce high densities of deuterons, 10^25 to 25/cc.  An electrically driven piezo device filled with D2O produces acoustic field generating TCBs that are, in the final collapse stage, micro accelerators.  The result is the implanting of deuterons into a target foil producing 4He originating from the Pd foil and T from the Ti foil.  We are an emergent tangent technology to sonoluminescence, SL, technology, which we use to give us an environmental parameter probe into the bubble contents at the moment of its highest energy density.  (Much of the SL studies center on the pulses of photons coupled to the irradiating acoustic field emanating from an oscillating single stable cavitation bubble, SSCB.) The generation of these photons relates to conditions for the target implantation process.  Recently we have been studying the effects of frequency on multi TCB SL conditions that produce fusion.  These experiments and the analytical methods have concentrated on the mass spectroscopy of reactor gases, calorimetry of the reactor and power supply, and the scanning electron microscope photographs of target foils.  The results from many experiments are pieced together to reach a plausible path for the TCB that terminates with deuterons implanting into a target with the resulting fusion events.  The use of SL for monitoring the bubble content?s high energy densities allows for reactor parameter management for fusion events in the target foil.  Studies of multi TCBs' SL at higher temperatures (300-450?K), external pressures (10^6-10^7.5 dynes/cm2) and frequencies (.02- 1.7 MHz) are proceeding in a search for better fusion environments.

Cavitation jets implant high-density deuteron clusters into a target foil. Clusters are then squeezed by accelerated charges that form dense transient EM pulses. Cavitation and the associated sonoluminescence phenomena, used as a measuring tool, helps develop and explain related experimental results. Two outcomes, sonofusion and sono-superconductivity both produce D+clusters in reactors of different geometries. MHz reactor No. 1 is driven by a disk piezo and has produced excess heat, Qx, using the foil target and other products, including 4He. The newMHz reactor No. 2 is driven by a cylindrical piezo lowpower with a concentric wire target with transient cluster steady state concentration near the wire surface.

It was anticipated that ambient sono-superconductivity was possible but so far has proved difficult to measure. Cavitation D2O bubbles in both reactors were controlled by three main parameters for the two reactors: temperature, pressure of Ar gas over D2O, and acoustic watt input; Ti, Pi, andQa. The z-pinch jets?contents of deuterons and electrons were implanted, with an induced picosecond transient charge separation. This charge separation produced an electromagnetic, EM, cluster compression pulse that formed a high-density BEC environment, as the EM pulse pressure overwhelmed repulsive deuteron cluster pressure for that picosecond.

In 1994 the samples were run at LANL and measured at PNNL. The helium was measured by melting small TF pieces cut from the active center zone. Then each piece was placed in a crucible, and melted under vacuum, releasing all gases including background helium. These collected gases from one piece were pretreated; then were measured. The data was converted to total 4He atoms trapped in the active zone of the TF lattice. A total of 24 measurements for 3He and 4He on three TFs found no 3He but 4He in all 12 measurements.

Free electrons were focused on clustered deuterons that compressed the deuterons like a spherical piston, squeezing a Meso-Cluster (MC) of deuterons. The compressed clusters were different from the deuterium clusters used by A. Takahashi. A reaction pathway similar to muon fusion was observed. The RF applied at a deuteron resonance, produced charge neutrality in the plasma?s electromagnetic (EM) pathway where alpha production was observed. Each MC consisted of 2?100 deuterons. Here we will use 10 deuterons to describe the MC and its alpha production, within time frame A. The changing MC density, pressure, and temperature were critical to alpha production, within time frame A. The MC volume was about 10-39 m3 and compression force was continuously applied to the MC located at the target foil (TF) surface. The heat transport was fast, and MCs were confined by electromagnetic fields (EM) tangent to the MC interface and motion of the neutralizing electrons. It is conjectured in this paper that the neutralizing plasma in time frame A produced a shockwave (SW) using a single electron to form a D atom that fused two deuterons in the MC to create an alpha. Before the fusion reaction, the surface target foil atoms were cavitating for an active period of 100 ns duration with each RF cavitation resonance cycle (see the main text in Fig 4).  . . .","Cavitation resonance, Deuterons, Free electrons, MC clustered radio frequency, Target foils, Time frame",4017_BiberianJPjcondensedzc.pdf,,49.0,70.0

Measuring and finding He produced in a vacuum tight reactor with no air leaks where mass spectral (MS) system analyses numbers would be disturbed.

During experiments, dV/dt rapid changes were noted in volumes of proton and deuteron capturing an electron as the initial temperature cools. This is a very basic event at the atomic level. The D+ + e-D* will produce a shockwave that is only compressive for the elemental hydrogen isotopes. The shock wave that destroys the MC cluster of deuterons in a squeezing process, ends with an explosion that excites the MC debris. An excited state occurs where a free MC deuteron combines with the D*forming an alpha as part of the debris system for that cycle. He4 was collected in the Ar gas phase for a mass spectroscopy analysis, MS. Only the 3 hydrogen isotopes have the potential of the large dV/dt compression.Old measurements of the sonoluminescence (SL) photons emitted during DOD cavitation fits RF experiments, and it was never thought He4 might be associated with SL. But a closer look makes a case that SL and gamma photons were the same. The RF system during DOD cavitation could be associated with the improbable equation 2D He4 + g. The measured SL fits the RF He4 MS measurements. The advantage of the RF amplifier driven system was its freedom of a locked frequency of the oscillator driven systems and can be frequency tuned while running. The system could be tuned off for 5 s temperature measurement in the 30 s run mode, thus avoiding the high RF field interference to thermocouple measurements.

Time-Space-Oscillation `TSO' connected to matter is a physical perspective able to explain CF and the Particle-Wave-Duality, even able to propose technical means for further development. According to this perspective a particle -even at rest- is joined to a real, centripetal TSO, a 'de Broglie oscillation', instead of a mathematical Schr?dinger wave function1). This TSO-field propagates with velocity c toward a focus, where the particle is created as a flickering wave vertex, that can push an instrument trigger. Particles and nuclides including their Coulomb barriers, thus become endowed with phase dependency and a centripetal wave field, that can interfere in slits. This explains the Particle-Wave Duality and why the Coulomb barrier can be tunneled under certain phase conditions.. This TSO-perspective further hints at nuclear reactions of a 'centripetal' kind different from those based on 'translational collisions', described by present high energy physics.

An applied magnetic field ~0.3 T increases the LANR solution?s electrical resistance ~10-17% with a time constant in minutes. The incremental resistance increase to an applied H-field is greatest at low loading current. The incremental resistance increase from an applied H-field is greatest with the applied H-field perpendicular to the driving electrical field (E-field) intensity. The modified LANR deuteron loading rate equation indicates that an applied magnetic field intensity increases deuteron loading in a LANR system by the increasing solution resistance and limiting undesired gas evolving reactions.","Deuterium, Deuterons, Excess heat, Excess power gain, Flux, Lattice assisted nuclear reactions, Loading, Metamaterials, Nanostructures, Optimal operating point, Palladium",4074_BiberianJPjcondensedc.pdf,,101.0,113.0

This paper presents a new generation of preloaded LANR (CF) activated nanocomposite ZrO2?PdNiD CF/LANR quantum electronic devices capable of energy gain.

All the anti-Stokes peaks are relatively missing in the undriven mode for all of the nanostructured materials. Weak anti-Stokes peaks are elicited from Pd (and Ni and their alloy) nanostructured material in ZrO2. But when NANOR-type components are electrically driven, there is diversity in outcome. When driven in the avalanche mode, the anti-Stokes peaks differ considerably from those which appear during the excess heat (XSH)-producing or desired mode. The anti-Stokes peak(s) differ in energy, amount, and in what stimulates their appearance. However, normal anti-Stokes peaks return when the electrical drive creates ""avalanche mode"" characterized by higher electrical current at decreasing voltage. The avalanche anti-Stokes peaks are many, and they are lower energy than the XSH mode produced anti-Stokes peak (described main text). By contrast, successful cold fusion is heralded by a large increase in the anti-Stokes to Stokes (aS/S) ratio, and the generated anti-Stokes peak for the desired and XSH-producing state is very different from the avalanche-generated multiple anti-Stokes peaks. That XSHrelated peak is singular and at higher energy. This distinguishing, higher energy, single, anti-Stokes peak is also not seen in the ""off"" state or the avalanche (undesirable) mode. Our analysis finds that the excess-heat produced anti-Stokes peak is matched to the Stokes line of PdD. We also find that the several lower energy anti-Stokes in avalanche mode (unsuccessful regarding CF/LANR) are matched to the many Stokes peaks for zirconia. In the desired electric-driven XSH-producing mode, the two-terminal deuterided NANORr-type CF/LANR component has a measured Boltzmann Stokes ratio ~1.3. Analysis of the phonon gain heralds ~7^+/- 0 15 acoustic phonons assisting nuclear reactions and a core peak calculated Stokes temperature of circa 1645 K.

The relations are quasi-linear up to a current density of a few A/cm^2. The limiting current continues for a few volts to a few hundred volts, depending on the metal. a glow develops at the electrode and becomes continuous at the end of the plateau, where the cd increases irregularly(breakdown). The breakdown potential does not depend on the field in the water. It occurs at about the same cd for most metals. When electrolytes are added, the cell potential at the breakdown is increased. Adsorbed layers and organic coatings increase the breakdown potential. Electrical energy storage in water is increased by ~10 times by coatings. The breakdown potential decreases with increase of the log of rate constant for H evolution on the various electrodes and with corresponding work function. The cell potentials for breakdown correspond to fields in the dielectric below that needed to dissociate it. The limiting current is caused by the formation of a H2-steam layer at the interface, which causes increase in the electrode potential at constant current. The H2-steam layer plasmolyzes. When the Fermi level in the cathode reaches the conduction band of water, electrons enter the water and remain stable therein. They interact nonadiabatically with water and are .the head of streamers. An analogous model holds for holes in the valence band.

In the months and years that followed, other manifestations of nuclear activities in this system were observed, viz. tritium and helium production and transmutation of elements. In this report, we present additional evidence, namely, the emission of highly energetic charged particles emitted from the Pd/D electrode when this system is placed in either an external electrostatic or magnetostatic field. The density of tracks registered by a CR-39 detector was found to be of a magnitude that provides undisputable evidence of their nuclear origin. The experiments were reproducible. A model based upon electron capture is proposed to explain the reaction products observed in the Pd/D-D2O system.","cr-39, particle emission",4130_SzpakSfurtherevi.pdf,,,

This success hasn?t come easily and is due to several factors. One key reason for this success was the courage of the SSC-Pacific upper management in allowing scientists to conduct research and publish results in a controversial field. The few journal editors, who had the fortitude to consider our work, also contributed to this success. This contrasts with the majority of their peers who, taking the path of least resistance, ignored our work out of hand and returned manuscripts with, ?the subject matter is not in the purview of the journal'. The reviewers also played a role in the successful publication of LENR-related papers. A multitude of reviewers, many outside the LENR field, had to put aside their biases and look objectively at our data.? In turn, the reviewers' relentless concerns forced us to tenaciously address their issues.

First identified in reduced polycrystalline titanium dioxide (an n-type semiconductor) to Group VIII metal particles, the interface significantly affects the Schottky barrier height resulting in electron flow into the metal particles from the reduced titanim dioxide (TiO2) based on their respective work functions. The result is a negative charge on the metal particles which is of sufficient magnitude and duration to provide cathodic protection of the metal particles from surface oxidation. In essence, the metal particles behave as a negatively charged electrode without an externally supplied power source.","Microspheres, Pechini process, Polycrystalline, Submonolayer, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy",4146_BiberianJPjcondensede.pdf,,86.0,98.0

Values of channel dependent fission barriers were calculated by using liquid drop model potentials for Pd isotopes. Fission products were analyzed in detail. Major fission products (FPs) are stable isotopes and the isotopic ratios of FP elements are very different from those of natural abundances.

Considering a transient condensation process of deuteron-cluster in focal points of metal-deuteride lattice, electron screening effect was theorized by the Electronic Quasi-Particle Screening Theory (EQPET) model for a transient deuteron cluster associating attracted electrons. Multibody resonance fusion of deuterons was proposed by modeling charged-pion exchange for strong interaction in very condensed deuteron cluster to lead to select the tetrahedral resonance fusion (TRF) of 4D and octahedral resonance fusion (ORF) of 8D as possible major reaction channels in extreme case. 4He is the final product of TRF and ORF. Tritium and 3He was suggested as minor products from 3D multi-body fusion. Visible but very small level production of neutron by D + D (2D) fusion was also concluded. Further extension of EQPET model is given to propose a dynamic Bose-type condensation process by orthogonally coupled two D2 molecules, which play a role of super screening of Coulomb barrier with quadruplet electronic quasi-particle to generate clean fusion product of 4He.","Ash, Bosonization, Deuteron cluster fusion, Electronic quasi-particle screening, 4D Fusion, 8D Fusion, Helium-4, Secondary reaction",4194_BiberianJPjcondensed.pdf,,68.0,91.0

Also the proton capture with Ni-nucleus, if any with kW level power, should emit lethal prompt gamma-rays which have never been observed. So, this type of nuclear reactions is unlikely.(2) Deuteron impurity (1/6700 in H2 gas usually) may induce (3H+D)/TSC fusion to be considered. Conditioning of 3-dimensional symmetry of QM-wave function for TSC is however of problem to condense into microscopic neutral entity small enough for causing any strong interactions.(3) The newly proposed 4H/TSCWS (weak-strong interaction simultaneously) fusion is a plausible scenario to have clean products (3He and proton, or deuterons) with significantly enhanced reaction rates in Ni nano-particles, for rare-conditioned (as discussed) visible heat generation with very weak secondary neutrons (10-13 order of 3He primary product)  and gamma-rays (10-11 order of 3He primary product). Degrees of the generation rate of 4H/TSC (t = 0) transient clusters in Ni-H nano-particles and the life-time elongation of 4H/TSC-minimum state are speculatively studied. The auto-recovery capability of Ni nano-catalyst is considered as the key.(4) The 4H/TSC + Ni-isotope capture-and-fission process, previously proposed in our paper of JCMNS 1 (2007) 86-96 is another plausible scenario, to result in generation of clean fission products in A < 60 mass region. More enhanced 4p + Ni to fission rates than the previous prediction is expected due to the possible elongation of 4H/TSC-minimum-state life time without complete nuclear break-up of the symmetric cluster under dynamic condensation.","Clean fission, 4H/TSC WS fusion, Ni + H CF experiments, Ni + 4H/TSC capture, Nuclear reaction models",4211_BiberianJPjcondensedh.pdf,,113.0,132.0

The Pd?Ni10/zirconia (PNZ10) and Cu?Ni7/zirconia (CNZ7) powders by melt-spun and calcination method were for AHE active material samples, and were re-used by additional calcination. An amount of 80?400 W/kg level excess thermal power Wex of sustainable continuity for several weeks has been reproducibly observed at elevated temperature around 300?C, by using re-calcined PNZ-type samples with D-gas, significantly in net D-gas desorption mode. Specific reaction energy (?-value) per D-transferred was very large as from 100 eV/D to 500 eV/D. Very weak (0.1?0.2 n/J level) neutron emission looked correlating with the rise-up heat burst of thermal power after joule heating started. These results can be of the circumstantial evidence of the AHE by the nano-metal D-gas interaction. Data of 50-140 W/kg level excess thermal power was repeatedly obtained by CNZ-type samples with H-gas at elevated temperatures after the saturation of H-gas absorption (endothermic) by sample. Excess thermal power of ca. 50?70 W continued for more than two weeks by 505 g CNZ7r (re-calcined) sample, with very strange evolution of the cooled-flat and oscillating TC4 RC upper flange temperatures. . . . .","Anomalous heat, Circumstantial nuclear evidence, Enhancement, Elevated temperature, Excess thermal power, Gas turbulence, Hydrogen gas, 100 W/kg, Nano-composite-metals, Ni-based, Over 1 keV/H(D), Repeated calcination, Specific reaction energy Band States",4217_BiberianJPjcondensedzf.pdf,,20.0,38.0

Various data of excess heat including as high as 250 % were obtained for the former method for the drilled charcoal cathode by concentrating the current. It was found that there were strong correlation between the data and the each temperature rise in the beginning short time, suggesing that the excess heat is due to the same mechanism.

The thermodynamic properties of the micro drops in a bubble,where the pressure is 1 atm, is represented by Laplace's equation, i.e. the pressure(P)-volume(V) curves for various temperatures and the pressure-temperature(T) curves for various volume are drawn. The P-V and P-T curves demand the presence of the surface structure of the liquid and is named here as super water. The P-T curve shows a negative slope increasing as the volume decreases.This property is analysed by the third Maxwell's thermodynamic equation that the entropy is negative . When a microdrop receives a negative pressure the phase change from the normal water to the super water occurs and heat is generated. As the actuation is not by energy,the heat is excess heat. This occurs in both light and heavy water. The cold fusion arises in the minimum microdrop of heavy water under high actuation,as the super liquid is supposed to be liquid plasma and violent concussion is given there. Another effect of the negative pressure to the microdrop is to make it work by increasing the volume like an engine. An actuated microdrop synthesizes a new material whose resolution heat is equivalent to that released in the absence of the synthesis.","theory, Pd, D2O, heat, ICCF-7",4224_ENECOtheseventh.pdf,,383.0,387.0

Surface plasmons in metal nanoparticulates strongly interact with electromagnetic fields at their resonance, resulting in an intense focusing of the incident energy around the metal surface. It is therefore possible to take the advantage of such high energy concentration, under laser or electric power input, for instance by simply coating the conventional Pd-based fuel materials with noble-metal nanoparticles or nanoshells. This field-enhancement effect can be a powerful method to boost the fusion-triggering electromagnetic or optical energy to significantly improve the reaction rate and experimental reproducibility, and to create low-D-load fusion systems. Importantly, this enhancement scheme is applicable to both gas- and liquid-phase systems, and furthermore, not only for laser/optical power, but also for the conventional electrolysis systems due to the equivalency between light and electromagnetic fields. We also show that the conventional fusion-catalyzing metals of Pd, Ni, and Ti themselves intrinsically exhibit a certain degree of field enhancement for their nanostructured form. Therefore, we point out that this plasmonic effect may have been unknowingly produced particularly in the electrolysis-type fusion experiments reported so far. This field-enhancement phenomenon thus could be a clue to solve the mystery of the energy supplied to overcome the gigantic Coulomb barrier to produce the fusion reaction observed with visible rates, as well as a powerful tool for further technical progress.","Electromagnetic field enhancement, Laser, Metal nanoparticles, Metal nanoshells, Nanophotonics, Plasmonics, Power/energy density",4241_BiberianJPjcondensedw.pdf,,308.0,312.0

In this mechanism, electron currents play an important role, which are induced by an externally applied field or counterstreams of free electrons which naturally exist inside, surface and outside of bulk metals. At places of electron currents, the electric potential becomes negative and there relevant nuclei gather and collide. Then, if electrons exist in close vicinities in addition, there the electric potential barriers are lowered further and the tunneling effects which bring about nuclear fusions drastically increase. Resultantly, the rate of nuclear fusions enhances as a whole. Then, if shape of the current can be sufficiently fine and strong the increase is more drastic.

The co-deposited PdDxon highly loaded PdDxwires yielded greater excess energy than the bulk wire hydrides or PdDxco-deposited on Ag wires as predicted by the calculations of Hagelstein and DeChiaro.

Models that describe this also suggest that low energy vibrational quanta can be up-converted to produce nuclear excitation. Karabut?s collimated X-ray emission has been interpreted as being due to the up-conversion of vibrational energy in a small cathode to produce excitation in 201Hg. To test this, we developed a new experiment to vibrate a copper foil with and without surface Hg, and we looked for X-ray emission and charge emission from the surface. Signals were observed in the detectors in both cases; however, the signals in the X-ray detector did not respect the absorption edge of the Be window and are artifacts; and the large current signals associated with charge emission did not charge a capacitor in a simple configuration. We conclude that both are artifacts. The absence of collimated X-ray emission in this case is interpreted as due to the absence of strong low energy nuclear transitions in the copper, and also as ruling out a candidate theoretical model involving up-conversion due to interactions with negative energy transitions. A new interpretation of the Karabut experiment focuses now on lower frequency vibrations in the massive steel cathode holder and vacuum chamber as responsible for the up-conversion, and transfer of the up-converted energy to surface 201Hg to produce the collimated X-ray emission.","Charge emission, Collimated X-ray emission, Karabut experiment, Up-conversion, Vibrations",4264_BiberianJPjcondensedr.pdf,,118.0,126.0

Our isoperibolic (IPB) cell/calorimeter is operated as an isothermal compensation type calorimeter. Potential sources of error in this system are discussed as well the methods used to minimize them. In power compensation mode the cell is held at a constant temperature using a heater power feedback system and constant power pulses or DC power steps are added to the system, resulting in a reduction of heater power. The relationship between this heater power reduction and DC power passed along the reactor core yields a calibration curve at different temperatures that allows us to evaluate how much output power increased during a given stimulation pulse. The IPB cell/calorimeter was stimulated by commanding different pulse widths at constant amplitude with the pulse power held constant by appropriately varying the pulse repetition rate. At 250?300?C the ratio of output power increase to input pulse power varied from 1.0 to over 2.0 depending on the pulse width at constant input power. That ratio was always 1.0 at all pulse widths attempted at 600?C. These results have been seen tens of times. The amount of excess power was also dependent on the composition of the gas and the metal alloy coatings on the core. The outer layer of the core was always pure Ni. The composition of a multilayer metal?dielectric metal coated core was chosen to allow for reasonable hydrogen solubility and mobility at 300?C. The results of various experiments are discussed Importantly these results presented here ignore the heater power necessary to maintain temperature and the losses in the pulse generator, which can be several times greater than either the stimulation power or power gain.","Controlled electron capture, Hydrogen, Isoperibolic, Nickel, Power compensation",4265_BiberianJPjcondensedw.pdf,,313.0,323.0

XRD of powder removed from this sample showed the normal lattice spacing for pure Ni powder. However, THz imaging showed lattice dilation in the Ni coating. We discuss the potential source of this dilation as well as its possible importance to LENR.

With the latter method we present an intriguing result that shows tritium production in a unique Pd electrolysis experiment. EDX, ICP-OES, and ICP-MS can help the researcher understand the role of minor and major elemental impurities in these materials. If present, ICP-MS may also detect isotopic anomalies in these materials post experiment.

The Coulomb barrier, thermonuclear fusion, plasma, sounding from the lips of plasma physicists have nothing to do with cold nuclear fusion.

It is, however, often observed that the deuterium loading ratio struts decreasing after reaching a maximum value under a same electrolytic condition, and the maximum loading ratio could not be sustained for a necessary period of time to come up to observe any excess heat.To maintain such achieved high loading ratio, we have devised and confirmed a new technique based on a finding that a cell voltage during the electrolysis is one of the most important key factors to control such deloading.As the result of our new method, when the cell voltage is kept constant, accordingly electrolytic currents increase at a certain rate, the maximum deuterium loading can be maintained for more than 200 hours. It is found that the decrease in cell voltages is mostly due to the decrease in the deuterium overpotential, by measuring the deuterium overpotential on a palladium cathode.","Pd, loading, OCV, over voltage, D2O, electrolysis, ICCF-6",4281_NEDOthesixthin.pdf,,194.0,201.0

It is shown that the Coulomb potential is overscreened producing, at certain distances, an attractive potential between deuterium nuclei pairs and also between the deuterium nuclei and the surface atoms. This behavior of the effective potential in the deuterium plasma can be regarded as a counterpart of the Friedel oscillations of the electron gas at zero temperature. Because of this attractive potential, there are bound states for the deuteron pairs as well as for the surface atoms and deuterons. In these bound states the equilibrium distance between the nuclei is of the order 0.15 - 0.2 ? depending on the number density of deuterons. The fusion rate is calculated for the bounded deuteron pairs and it is found to be of the order?? per deuteron pair for the highest deuteron densities. Furthermore, it is shown that larger fusion rates are possible for the deuterons bound to the surface atoms. This may arise by a process, where the trapped deuterons share the released energy collectively via a proposed Multiple Resonance Scattering (MRS) mechanism. It is then found that the 4He-channel is the overwhelmingly dominant fusion channel. Moreover, the appearance of the transmutation processes in this MRS procedure are briefly discussed.",theory,4303_ToimelaTeffectivei.pdf,,,

We assume that the elements found only on the cathode surface, and nowhere else in the cell as contamination, namely iron, titanium, chromium and so on, must be transmutation products.

It was found that the ultra sonic effect strongly depends on a target condition and the D+D reaction could be enhanced very much due to the liquid Li cavitation. In addition, the D+D reaction rate is not constant but time dependent. Preliminary analyses indicate that decrease of the Coulomb energy barrier is about 2000 eV for a relatively stable condition. On the contrary, the Li+D reaction shows no meaningful effect for incident energies down to 30 keV.

The main subject of these presentations was the description of experimental techniques and analysis of the results of calorimetric measurements, which in a number of cases indicated anomalous heat release, sometimes very significant, accompanying the process of electrochemical deuteration of Pd cathodes. However, the processes occurring in the cathode material, in particular, its structural transformations occurring during the absorption of deuterium by palladium, in these reports have appeared practically outside of discussion.

Cold fusion in metals becomes possible due to the fact that the implantation of atoms in a crystal guides them to their p excitation levels, which are determined primarily by the positioning of free conduction electrons in a zone of potential sites. The excitation energy of the p-states is about 10?14 eV. The excited atoms? orientation in the crystal is not random but dictated by the crystal lattice?s electrostatic potentials. Calculations show that the transparency of the Coulomb potential barrier, for example, in the case of DD-fusion, increases by about 60 orders of magnitude if two deuterium atoms meet each other in the minima of the conductor?s potentials in the crisscross orientation. Most of the papers are devoted to the process of DD-fusion in the electrolytic saturation by deuterium in crystals, a process that is extensively studied in these experiments.

Discovered by Rontgen as long ago as 1895, this type of radiation occurs when the beta-electrons from a disintegrating beta-emitter are braked in the surrounding matter, being termed ""external bremsstrahlung"" in this case. But in such isotopes the beta-electron is also accompanied by a type of radiation that is independent of the surrounding matter. This type is called ""internal bremsstrahlung"", because it is generated by the electron inside the radioactive atom, during the decay process. It was first demonstrated by Aston 1) in the ""twenties"" when, in the course of gamma-ray measurements on RaE, he detected a soft, inhomogeneous form of gamma-radiation.","titanium, tritium, reduced radioactivity",4390_vandeVateJtheinterna.pdf,,,

In addition to this, it can be shown that combinations of these cycles can attain even higher efficiencies.

The considered system is a lattice ion trap for deuterons, supposing that over a certain concentration they occupy the tetrahedral sites. The electron motions seem to have a dominant role in the dynamics of two deuterons moving around such lattice sites.

In this paper a quantum description of a deuteron dynamics and its interaction with an other one inside the lattice ion trap is carried out taking advantage of an oscillating behaviour that can be traced back to a quantum harmonic oscillator.

It has been shown that positive ions (i.e. deuterons) confined by means of a quadrupolar electro-dynamic containment around palladium lattice tetrahedral sites (lattice ion trap) can dramatically decrease their mean distance. In the proposed picture the coherent oscillations of the Fermi level electrons of the metal atoms seem to have a dominant role in the deuterons dynamics.In this work the dynamics of the particles is studied in the trap coordinate system, rather than in the particles relative ones, since in this way it is possible to follow the position of a moving particle (e.g. deuteron or proton) inside the metal lattice cell. The lattice e.m. signal has been described as an oscillating dipole one.Such a description allows us also to study the behaviour of the moving particles when their trajectory is close to the metal lattice atoms.The calculations confinn the collision mechanism and show an interaction effect between the moving particles and the metal lattice atoms.","theory, ICCF-7",4417_ENECOtheseventh.pdf,,403.0,408.0

The differences between a ""black"" film and a pure nickel film ""blank"" behaviour are showed. The black Ni-hydride film has been obtained by a short electrolysis with 1 M? Li2SO4 electrolyte in light water. A shift in the minimum of the observed reflected light occurs, together with a change in the minimum shape, i.e. its half-height width increases. This two phenomenon are due to the change in the electronic band structure of the metal induced by the electron added in the lattice by hydrogen. The changing of the electronic structure, revealed by the laser coupling conditions, leads to consider that an hydride phase was created. Both the blank (not hydrogenated) and black (hydrogenated) specimens were taken under He-Ne laser beam at the reflectance minimum angle for about three hours. A SIMS analysis was also implemented to reveal differences in the isotopic composition of Cu, as marker element, between the blank and black films, in order to study the coupled effect of electrolysis and plasmon-polariton excitation on LENR processes in condensed matter.","nickel, transmutation",4426_ViolanteVanalysisof.pdf,,,

Correlations between the material status and the occurrence of the effect as well as some changes in the electrochemical interface status have been observed. Although during the last two decades, in several calorimetric experiments the effect was observed to be well above the measurement uncertainty, the mechanism producing the excess power is not completely understood. So far, the lack of reproducibility has been responsible for the absence of a clear explanation of the phenomenon based on experimental apparatus designed to enhance the spectrum of information required to define the effect. Recently, In order to improve this aspect of this research, specific work has been carried out to investigate whether the excess power was produced concurrently with the emission of Radio Frequency from the active cathode. Suitable probes and triggering included in the RF experimental system revealed RF signal emission during electrochemical loading of palladium samples, and a correlation between the heat production, in active samples, and RF signal emission was found. The preliminary results highlight the importance of performing studies on the electrodynamic effects that may be involved in the phenomenon, and the importance of the design of appropriate instruments designed to investigate unexplored regions of metal hydrogen systems.","Anomalous heat effect in metal hydride, Electrochemistry, Electromagnetic stimulation, Fleischmann and Pons effect, Metal hydrides and deuterides, Palladium, Palladium alloys, Radiofrequency",4442_BiberianJPjcondensedr.pdf,,327.0,332.0

The enabling process is non-nuclear and is one of controlling the Deuterium (D) chemical potential. After surpassing a high threshold D chemical potential, some of the true deuterium reactants, Dx's, are able to form. The formation of the new Dx's involves a change of state of the D's which reduces their repulsion forces and increases the probability of spontaneous fusion events. Once some of the Dx's are in place, there, indeed, is coupling between the non-nuclear and nuclear processes as shown by the experimental measurement of the heat produced.In this paper, existing experimental data are used to show how to enable and control the heat-producing process.

Eight runs, about six hours each, over a period of 16 days, gave an average of 1.8 watt excess thermal power output compared with a light water control cell. This is about twice the excess obtained in co-deposition experiments. The excess thermal power output ranged from 0.5 ? 0.1 W to 2.6 ? 0.1 W, which was an average of about 17 % more than the input power. The additive apparently catalyzes heat producing reactions on the surface of the palladium.

The differences between the application of these two kind beams were obtained by comparing the radiation yields of X-ray, gamma-ray, charged particle and neutron induced by each deuteron of two kinds of beam at the same velocity. The fusion rate induced by each cluster-deuteron in the energy region below 40 keV/d was higher than that induced by each isolated deuteron at the same velocity. However the fusion rate induced by each cluster-deuteron was less in the energy region above 50 keV/d. Ratio of the fusion rate induced by each cluster deuteron to that induced by each isolated deuteron was energy dependent. The yield of X-ray induced by each cluster deuteron in the energy region from 10 keV/d to 100 keV/d was higher than that induced by each isolated deuteron at the same velocity. The average ratio of their X-ray yields is about 2.6. Based on above results, it is considered there might be an enhancement of interaction cross-section in both nuclear and atomic levels in lower energy region. If the size of cluster ion is grown, the enhancement might be increased more. Therefore, the concentrated deuterons (deuterium in larger clusterstate) could have some relations with ""cold fusion "" phenomena in high loading metal.","ion bombardment, X-ray, cluster, D2, ICCF-7",4515_ENECOtheseventh.pdf,,480.0,484.0

The peak could be seen in almost every run of experiment. The counts of this peak kept almost constant ratio (about 0. 07) with the D-D proton peak that took place within the deuteron implanting ?range. Therefore, this unknown peak was considered as charged particle from unknown reaction (e.g. proton/rom D-D fusion) that occurred deeply (beyond the deuteron range) inside the palladium target plate. The reaction should be induced by some other trigger conditions except the direct beam-target effect of deuteron implantation. Similar phenomena were also observed, while the Ti. Fe, Ni. Cu and Mo foils (plates) were applied as targets, but the depth profiles of the reaction zones were quite different for different targets. Temperature of target has made some influence on reaction place. Both of cluster ion (D3+) and isolated deuteron (D+) beams were applied to the experiment. The results have shown that each isolated deuteron could induce higher rate of unknown reaction, compared with each deuteron of cluster ion beam. The experimental results show that the unknown reaction had some kind of dependence on ion states, target materials, temperature, deuterium loading ratio, etc. conditions. These factors are similar to the usually considered key factors in other type cold fusion experiments.

It had been noted that experiments (8-cell) with smaller cathodes (larger perimeter to area ratio) performed better than experiments (SEC system) in which larger cathodes (smaller perimeter to area ratio) were used.? In an effort to increase the magnitude of the excess power output, slits were introduced into the larger cathodes to increase the perimeter to area ratio.? Two SEC systems were used during the course of these experiments.? Using data from the first SEC system we find that four of seven (57%) of the experiments with slit cathodes showed an excess thermal power, averaging 322 mW (ranging from 136 to 509 mW) and five of fourteen (36%) of the experiments with no cathode slits gave excess thermal power, averaging 171 mW (ranging from 115 to 233 mW).? Overall, 10 of 13 (77%) of the experiments with slit cathodes showed excess power while only 5 of 15 (30%) of the experiments with no slits in the cathodes showed excess power.? This result shows an increase in both the magnitude and reproducibility of the excess power output effect.? In addition, Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) was performed on several cathodes (post-experiment) where greater concentrations of unexpected elements are found in those cells that showed excess power compared to those cells that did not show excess power.",titanium electrolysis D2O H2SO4 heat transmutation ICCF-9,4528_WarnerJelectrolys.pdf,,,

The experimental values of the ratio I-EBS were between four and thirty times lower than the ratio I-IBS predicted by theory. This discrepancy may be due either to the generation of characteristic x-radiation in the experimental arrangement used or to the fact that the theory is not applicable to tritium on account of its extremely low atomic number and beta-ray energy.

Total tritium analysis was performed on all hermetically sealed cells before and after each experiment. Tentative evidence is presented for neutron generation and a single anomalous heat excursion. A novel high-pressure electrochemical cell is also described which employs a fuel cell approach, thereby avoiding oxygen evolution. Two anomalous heat excursions have been observed in this cell with excess power values up to 30%.

No tritium was detected in four control cells, containing H2S04 in H2O, employing Pd cathodes cut from the same wire spool. Tritium amounts were from 7 x 10^10 to 2.1 ? 10^11 atoms, corresponding to average generation rates from 5.1 ? 10^4 to 2 ? 10^5 atoms/sec/cm^2. In all cases, D/Pd and H/Pd loadings of 1 ? 0.05 were attained. A cyclic loading/unloading regime rather than the usual continuous constant current regime was applied to attain these high loadings. Tritium analysis was performed in Pd, electrolyte and the gas head space of the sealed cells. Maximum tritium concentrations of 8.9 ? 10^10 atoms/g Pd, 180 times the detection limit, were found in the D-loaded Pd cathodes, none in the Η-loaded Pd, Also, no tritium within detection limit was found in 150 unused Pd pieces. Of these, 13 were cut randomly from the same wire spool as the four D-loaded Pd cathodes. The probability that the tritium in the latter was due to random spot contamination is computed as 1 in 2,380. It is concluded that the tritium was generated by nuclear reactions in the Pd. However, no tritium was detected in four D-loaded Pd cathodes of a different type in spite of attaining loadings D/Pd = 1. Different metallurgical history and impurity contents may play an important role.","tritium, Pd, D2O, contamination, D/Pd, electrolysis, ICCF-4",4561_WillFGtritiumgen.pdf,,,

Tritium analysis was performed before and after each experiment on the Pd, the electrolyte and the gas in the head space. No tritium generation was observed in four identical Pd cathodes in H2SO4 cells operated at the same time under the same conditions. A cyclic loading-unloading regime with low current densities, rather than the usual continuous constant current regime, was employed to attain D/Pd and H/Pd loadings of 1 ? 0.05 reproducibly. D/Pd loadings greater than 0.8 ?0.05 appear to be necessary to generate tritium. The largest amount of tritium, generated in 7 days of continuous electrolysis, was 2.1 x 10E11 tritium atoms, compared with a background of 4 x 10E9 tritium atoms. The concentration of tritium and its axial distribution in the Pd were determined and concentrations of up to 9 x 10E10 atoms/g Pd were found compared with a maximum background of 5 x 10E8 atoms g-1. The T/D ratio in the Pd is about 100 times larger than in the electrolyte or gas and indicates that tritium generation occurs in the Pd interior rather than at its surface. No tritium generation was observed in two other types of Pd electrodes in D2SO4, despite the attainment of D/Pd ratios near 1:1. Thus high D/Pd ratios appear to be a necessary but not sufficient condition for tritium generation in D2SO4 electrolysis.","electrolysis, Pd, D2O, tritium, H2O, loading",4562_WillFGreproducib.pdf,,,

Low energy nuclear reactions (LENR) is evaluated for application to several areas including space travel, in which the vacuum of space cannot provide any propellant or other materials. It is assumed that LENR may become a practical source of useable energy. Several things must be considered for a successful journey from Earth to Mars, including the trip rout, the type of rocket, energy source, and the spacecraft speed. These are discussed for space travel using LENR. The velocity of the rocket increases as the mass flow rate decreases.

The real time observation has been performed by high-resolution quadrupole mass spectroscopy (0.001 amu at 4 amu). The amount of 4He gas produced was closely correlated with the evolution of excess heat, and it increased with the loading ratio of D to Pd. At the highest loading ratio of D to Pd, we have also observed T production by detecting HT. The amount of HT increased in the final stages of 4He production. The system of H-loaded Pd (Pd:H) heterostructure, on the other hand, produced neither 4He nor T. Furthermore, the energy spectrum of charged particles detected during these experiments has revealed that a particles with an energy of 4.5-6 Me V and protons with an energy of 3 Me V were emitted from the oxide surface of Pd.

The conductivity of LiOD not only affects the electrical and thermal properties but also can be used to determine the LiOD concentration. In this paper, conductivities of LiOD heavy water solution (0.01409 ~ 0.09721 mol*L^-1) at 10 ~ 70 deg C were measured. Changes of conductivity ? in mS*cm^-1 with concentration c in mol*L^-1 and temperature T in degrees C can be expressed by the quadratic form: ? = 60.56c ? 14.25c^2 + 2.514cT ? 0.5459c^2T. This relationship can be simplified to ? = 123.41c ? 27.90c^2 or c = 8.1031 x 10^-3 ?^2 + 1.484 ? 10^-5 ?^2 at 25 deg C.","LiOD heavy water solution, Conductivity, Molar conductivity, Lithium, Cold fusion",4724_BiberianJPjcondensedzi.pdf,T,276.0,283.0

We show how most of our predicted transmutation products are consistent with experimental data from a wide variety of LENR experiments, and how they can be triggered. Chemical physics recently discovered a new type of chemical reaction that concentrated most of the energy of reactants into electrons that were originally trapped between reactants. The reaction leaves the reaction product molecule relatively cool. Considering the rules of solid state physics, we apply the pattern of these chemical reactions to nuclear reactions, referred to as ""Lattice Enabled Nuclear Reactions"" (LENR, also called ""Low Energy Nuclear Reactions""). The predicted nuclear energy release also concentrates the energy in electrons, energized inside the nuclear product. The nuclear products are predicted to be ""cold"", implying non-radioactive, ground state. In some cases the excitation energy of the compound nucleus is sufficient to fracture it into more isotopes that were not originally present. The total attraction energy (coulomb plus nuclear) can overcome the quantum kinetic energy repulsion of the squeezed electron quasi-particles (Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle) when the effective electron mass exceeds a threshold value. . . .","Electron catalysis, Electron scattering, Kinetic energy of confinement, Transmutation, Vibrationally promoted electron emission",4736_BiberianJPjcondensedzb.pdf,T,385.0,400.0

The model combines several phenomena to derive the conditions where a binding potential energy and an electron?s Coulomb bond can combine to attract the ions together to form a new nucleus. We hypothesize that heavy electron quasiparticles are created by placing electrons near inflection points of a lattice band diagram and last about one collision time (~10 fs). They are placed near the inflection point by injection of phonons carrying crystal momentum, which last picoseconds, long enough to create many generations of transient heavy electron quasiparticles. We consider the interaction of two ions, such as a nickel nucleus and a proton, separated by a distance x with an electron of mass m trapped between them. The increase in energy needed to confine the electron (Kinetic Energy of Confinement, KEC) ? 1/(mx2) from the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle acts like a repulsive potential. . . .","Band structure, Catalysis, Heavy electron, Muon, Transmutation, Tunneling",4737_BiberianJPjcondensedzd.pdf,T,67.0,95.0
